# Sectoral Competition and Structural Transformations in Latin America: The Political Origins of the Industrial Sector, 1900-2010


##### Hector Bahamonde, December 2016


#### New Framing and Empirical Strategy

Originally, this paper sought to find the *origins* of industrial development. The plan was to use the *dual sector* model to explain under what conditions strong industrial emerge. The best outcome would have been a paper saying something among these lines: "when the agriculture sector was efficient, it liberated labor, etc." I think it would have been *too* descriptive, *too* of an "economic" paper, and not that interesting.

Instead, the new framing explains "political development." It does so by incorporating sectoral conflict, and how the conflict was rooted in economic structural transformations that took place around 1900s. The sectoral competition is the same one **described** *Paper 1*. However, in *Paper 2* I explain the mechanics of this conflict using the *dual sector* model. Next section explains the basic theory.

The empirical execution of the paper will not be a traditional one. The dependent "variable" (**political development**) will be a classification made by Mahoney in his book entitled "Colonialism and Postcolonial Development." In his classification, countries are ordered in a three-way continuum ("high", "intermediate".  "low"). The statistical tests will tell me the direction in which the economy has developed in the long run. That is, whether the industrial developed caused agricultural development, or if it was the other way around. These tests will be used, in a "qualitative" way, if one wills, to classify the sample of countries following Mahoney's categories. That is, the way in which I interpret the tests should coincide with Mahoney's findings.
