# Sectoral Competition and Structural Transformations in Latin America: The Political Origins of the Industrial Sector, 1900-2010


##### Hector Bahamonde, December 2016


#### New Framing and Empirical Strategy

Originally, this paper sought to find the *origins* of industrial development. The plan was to use the *dual sector* model to explain under what conditions strong industrial emerge. The best outcome would have been a paper saying something among these lines: "when the agriculture sector was efficient, it liberated labor, etc." I think it would have been *too* descriptive, *too* of an "economic" paper, and not that interesting.

Instead, the new framing explains "political development." It does so by incorporating sectoral conflict, and how the conflict was rooted in economic structural transformations that took place around 1900s. The sectoral competition is the same one **described** *Paper 1*. However, in *Paper 2* I explain the mechanics of this conflict using the *dual sector* model. Next section explains the basic theory.

The empirical execution of the paper will not be a traditional one. The dependent "variable" (**political development**) will be a classification made by Mahoney in his book "Colonialism and Postcolonial Development." In his typology, countries are ordered in a three-way continuum ("high", "intermediate".  "low"). My empirical strategy/tests will classify countries, and "fit" the data using Mahoney's classification as a parameter. The statistical tests specify the direction in which the economy developed. That is, whether the industrial developed caused agricultural development, or if it was the other way around. I explain in the next section *why* this directionality "means" **sectoral conflict**.


#### Theory

*Paper 1* argues that sectoral conflict caused the imposition of the income tax and that the income tax was a *state-building institution*, that is, an institution that *triggered* other "state-institutions." In *Paper 2*, I pursue this idea further, and argue that sectoral conflicts also caused *political development*. Like in *Paper 1*, I leave the operationalization of the dependent variable unspecified for the moment. It is in *Paper 3* where I measure my dependent variable.

**This is the basic argument of the paper**. When the agricultural sector grows at the expenses of the industrial sector, it is indicative that the post-colonial elite structure was never challenged. However, when the industrial sector grows at the expenses of the agricultural sector, it implies that the initial political/military/economic endowment landowners had inherited from the colonial period was altered. In essence, the **directionality** of economic development has a correlate of the change (or the absence of it) in sectoral power balance.

I argue that either directionality **perpetuates different selectorates**.

**Where is the sectoral competition?** The higher the intensity of the sectoral conflict, the more political development. Following the dual sector theory, a stronger *industrial* **strong** was needed *prior* to the development of a **strong** *industrial* sector. An efficient agriculture was able to free labor, that the incipient industrial class could rely on. Additionally, an efficient foodstuff production could supply and meet the increasing food demands of a growing industrial sector (the dual sector explains that this happens at a constant price, at least initially). *The sectoral conflict here is for political power*. The way in which **economic development** happens definitively alters their relative **political** endowments. For example, in my case study in *Paper 1*,
