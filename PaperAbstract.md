# Sectoral Competition and Structural Transformations in Latin America: The Political Origins of the Industrial Sector, 1900-2010


##### Hector Bahamonde, December 2016


#### New Framing and Empirical Strategy

Originally, this paper sought to find the *origins* of industrial development. The plan was to use the *dual sector* model to explain under what conditions strong industrial emerge. I think the paper would have been *too* descriptive, *too* of an "economic" paper.

Instead, the new framing explains "political development." It does so by incorporating sectoral conflict, and how the conflict was rooted in the economic structural transformation that took place around 1900s. The sectoral competition is the same one **described** in *Paper 1*. However, in *Paper 2* I explain the *mechanics* of this conflict using the *dual sector* model.

#### Theory

*Paper 1* argues that sectoral conflict caused the imposition of the income tax. The second part of the argument (which I left empirically untested) is that the income tax was a *state-building institution*, that is, an institution that *triggered* other "state-institutions." In *Paper 2* I take care of this untested proposition and **argue** that the income tax, as a political institution, helped countries to develop institutions that promoted both economic and political development. As in *Paper 1*, the income tax was a device that represented sectoral conflicts.


**Mechanics of the argument**. Building on the dual-sector economy model, I argue that the **directionality** of economic development indicates whether the elite structure, i.e. the inter-sectoral balance of power, (1) **preserved** or (2) **reversed** the post-colonial status-quo. What is *challenged*/*reversed* is the initial situation in which the rural landowners were the primary economic sector and most powerful elite. I argue that the inter-elite balance of power was challenged when the industrial sector grew **at the expenses** of the agricultural sector. The dual-sector model strongly agrees that this directionality is the path any country seeking to modernize should follow. Building on this idea, I claim that while this path causes **economic** development, it necessarily alters the **political** (and **military**) balance between the two elites. When the opposite happens, i.e. when the agricultural sector grew **at the expenses** of the industrial sector, the post-colonial elite structure was never challenged, and neither economic nor political development were achieved.

Continuing with the mechanics of the argument, an important point (that was left out of *Paper 1*) is that *all* countries, *eventually*, implemented the income tax. *Paper 1* does suggest that sectoral conflicts **accelerate** political development, in the form of the implementation of the income tax law. However, it is not clear whether political development caused economic development, or set the economy in a "development path." Institutional economists argue that political development should set the basis for economic development. However, the inter-sectoral distinction has been absent from this debate. In this paper I argue that, though all countries eventually implemented the income tax law, when its implementation reflected an inter-sectoral conflict, this institution set the basis for **economic development** (Paper 2's dependent variable). In other words, I seek to explain *economic development* as a function of *political development*.

**Where is the sectoral competition?** I argue that either *directionality* **perpetuates _different_ selectorates**. When  newcomers grow at the expenses of the historically dominant class, the selectorates expands, necessarily reducing the power of the historically dominant class (landowners). However, when the newcomers help growing the traditionally dominant class, the selectorate is not challenged, and the dominant ones continue being so. In other words, the direction in which **economic development** happens alters the sectoral relative **political** endowments. The selectorate is important as it permits the legitimated use of state power. I explained in *Paper 1* that there will be incentives to centralize state power when sectoral sizes are of about the same size. In *Paper 2* the same logic applies: when the system is challenged (which requires similar sectoral sizes), economic development happens. Consequently, the first type of conflict was political.

The second kind of conflict was economic. Following the dual sector theory, a **strong** *agricultural* sector was needed *prior* to the development of a **strong** *industrial* sector. An efficient agricultural sector was able to free labor that the incipient industrial class could rely on. Efficient foodstuff production also supplied and met the increasing food demands of a growing industrial sector (at a constant price, according to the literature). This

#### Empirics

The empirical/methodological execution of the paper will *not* be a traditional one. The dependent "variable" (**political development**) will be a classification made by Mahoney in his book "Colonialism and Postcolonial Development." In his typology, countries are ordered in a three-way continuum ("high", "intermediate" and  "low"). My empirical strategy/tests will classify countries, and "fit" the data using Mahoney's classification as a parameter. The statistical tests specify the direction in which the economy developed. That is, whether the industrial developed caused agricultural development, or if it was the other way around. I explain in the next section *why* this directionality "means" **sectoral conflict**.
