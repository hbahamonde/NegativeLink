# Sectoral Competition and Structural Transformations in Latin America: The Political Origins of the Industrial Sector, 1900-2010


##### Hector Bahamonde, December 2016


#### New Framing and Empirical Strategy

Originally, this paper sought to find the *origins* of industrial development. The plan was to use the *dual sector* model to explain under what conditions strong industrial emerge. The best outcome would have been a paper saying something among these lines: "when the agriculture sector was efficient, it liberated labor, etc." I think it would have been *too* descriptive, *too* of an "economic" paper, and not that interesting.

Instead, the new framing explains "political development." It does so by incorporating sectoral conflict, and how the conflict was rooted in economic structural transformations that took place around 1900s. The sectoral competition is the same one **described** *Paper 1*. However, in *Paper 2* I explain the mechanics of this conflict using the *dual sector* model. Next section explains the basic theory.

The empirical execution of the paper will not be a traditional one. The dependent "variable" (**political development**) will be a classification made by Mahoney in his book "Colonialism and Postcolonial Development." In his typology, countries are ordered in a three-way continuum ("high", "intermediate" and  "low"). My empirical strategy/tests will classify countries, and "fit" the data using Mahoney's classification as a parameter. The statistical tests specify the direction in which the economy developed. That is, whether the industrial developed caused agricultural development, or if it was the other way around. I explain in the next section *why* this directionality "means" **sectoral conflict**.


#### Theory

*Paper 1* argues that sectoral conflict caused the imposition of the income tax. The second part of the argument (which I left empirically untested) is that the income tax was a *state-building institution*, that is, an institution that *triggered* other "state-institutions." In *Paper 2* I take care of this untested proposition and argue that the income tax, as a political institution, helped countries to develop institutions that promoted both economic and political development. As argued in *Paper 1*, the income tax was a device that represented sectoral conflicts.


**Mechanics of the argument**. Building on the dual-sector economy model, I argue that the **directionality** of economic development indicates whether the elite structure, i.e. the inter-sectoral balance of power, (1) **preserved** or (2) **reversed** the colonial status-quo. What is challenged/reversed is the initial situation in which the rural landowners were the primary economic sector and most powerful elite. I argue that the political economy was not challenged, and the inter-elite balance of power was challenged when the industrial sector grew **at the expenses** of the agricultural sector. The dual-sector model strongly agrees in that this directionality is the path any country seeking to modernize should follow. Building on this idea, I claim that while this path causes **economical** modernization, it necessarily alters the **political** balance between the two elites. When the opposite happens, i.e. when the agricultural sector grew **at the expenses** of the industrial sector, the post-colonial elite structure was never challenged, and neither economic nor political development were achieved.



**Where is the sectoral competition?** I argue that either directionality **perpetuates different selectorates**.



The higher the intensity of the sectoral conflict, the more political development. Following the dual sector theory, a stronger *industrial* **strong** was needed *prior* to the development of a **strong** *industrial* sector. An efficient agriculture was able to free labor, that the incipient industrial class could rely on. Additionally, an efficient foodstuff production could supply and meet the increasing food demands of a growing industrial sector (the dual sector explains that this happens at a constant price, at least initially). *The sectoral conflict here is for political power*. The way in which **economic development** happens definitively alters their relative **political** endowments. For example, in my case study in *Paper 1*,
