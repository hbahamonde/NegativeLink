\citet{Waldner:1999aa} studies how the formation of a modern state should coincide with the incorporation of lower classes to produce developmental states,


Adopting the fiscal sociology paradigm, I contend that tax institutions \emph{made} the state, promoting not only bureaucratic development but also expanding the \emph{dominion} of the state.\footnote{Income taxation not only triggered other state capacities helping with the development of more skilled bureaucracies. Via a process of assimilation, it also helped to construct the figure of the \emph{citizen} centered around the concept of the \emph{taxpayer}. Regardless of an individual's race, religion, culture or any other kind of status, the state classifies its subjects according to their incomes and oblige them to pay, punishing whoever refuses to do so. From a sociological standpoint, this ``generality makes taxation a crucial element in the development of the `imagined community' (\citet[]{Anderson2006a}) of the modern nation-state [...] Taxation enmeshes us in the web of generalized reciprocity that constitutes modern society'' (Martin et al., in \citet[3]{Martin2009a}).} Analytically, this theory emphasizes the role of inter-elite (in)equality on political and economic (under)development.


Following \citet[311]{Jorgenson1961}, \citet[59]{Ranis:1964uq}, \citet[291]{Jorgenson1967}, \citet[279-280]{Skott1998} and \citet[290]{Vollrath2009a}, the industrial sector is assumed to use capital and labor (having both increasing returns to scale). And while the agriculture sector also needs capital,\footnote{\citet[40]{Federico:2008xd}.} I follow conventional wisdom in development economics and assume that agriculture uses land (which is fixed) as the main input, and labor. This implies that the industrial sector is \emph{structurally} advantaged: the fixity of land requires countries to industrialize in order to grow, and for that they need first an efficient agricultural sector. This insight is shared by many other development economists.

To address this situation, industrialists started to ``form trade associations to engage in lobbying and propaganda.''\footnote{\citet[107]{Weaver:1980vn}.} Eventually, these interests groups turned into political parties.\footnote{\citet[109]{Collier:2002db}.}


it is necessary ``a particular kind of model.''\footnote{\citet[571]{Wooldridge2002}. Cointegrated vectors, ECM and VAR models are widely common in political science too. Just to mention some examples, refer to \citet{Ostrom1992}, \citet{Krause1997}, \citet{Fish2007}, \citet{Haber2011}, \citet{Sobel2011}, \citet[489]{Herzer2012} and \citet{Blaydes2011}.} If traditional methods are used, given the interdependent relationship of these kinds of time-series, the results will be spurious.\footnote{\citet[142-143]{Ostrom1992}.} 


`Unit root' or `integrated' \emph{I(1)} vectors\footnote{The order of integration could be higher than 1. However, for simplicity sake, I restrict my analyses to I(1) processes, which is the most common strategy in applied econometric analyses of time series.} are time-series that ``wander'' up and down, yet they never reverse to a given mean.\footnote{\citet[129]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe}.} In other words, these are series whose innovations do not dissipate, but persist in time. And such, analysts usually study economic growth using this methodological framework. \footnote{See \citet{Granger1981} and \citet{Engle1987}).} A ``set of integrated time-series is said to be cointegrated if some linear combination of the series in levels produces a stationary series,'' or \emph{I(0)}.\footnote{\citet[193]{Durr1992}.}

	% why it's important to include time `trends'
	Because some variables grow with time, like economic growth (\citet[129]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe})
	``If a series has a deterministic trend, it will likely appear to grow (or decline) steadily over time. That is, the increase (or decrease) in the value of the series will be a direct function of time, rather than the previous values of the variable itself.''
	The case of growth seems to be `a stochastic trend,' these series ``wander'' up and down, yet never revert to a given mean. (p. 129, their wording).

\citet[149]{Ostrom1992}: ``before estimating a cointegrating regression, one generally should check to see that all elements of X, are integrated of the same order (usually I[1]).''

%\citet[164]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe}: there are two approaches to cointegration, ECM and Johansen's method.

\citet[161,164]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe}: Engle-Granger two step regression approach is ``the most commonly used methodology'' but Johansen's method has a number of advantages, such as being estimated via MLE (\citet[231-232]{Johansen1988}\footnote{``The reason for expecting the estimators to behave better than the regression estimates is that they take into account the error structure of the underlying process, which the regression estimates do not.''}) being the the most important one that traditional significance tests ``can be applied to the estimates of the speed of adjustment parameters in the Engle-Granger approach because they are based on estimated data in the two-step process.''

\citet[83]{DeBoef2001}: first, regress Y on X (this is the cointegration regression), if residuals I(0), go to second steep: regress delta Y on delta X, and lagged epsilon hat. Only the second stage is used for inferential purposes. % follow this setup-up.

\citet[263]{Fish2007}: ``The proper method for determining whether an equilibrium relationship exists between two nonstationary time series is to examine whether the series are cointegrated and then to conduct error correction regressions.''

% ECM

	% ECM is better than EG two-steep procedure.
	%\citet[84]{DeBoef2001}: ``The single-equation GECM is both theoretically appealing and also statistically superior to the two-step estimator in many case. \citet{Banerjee1993} show that dynamic regressions will be asymptotically equivalent to more complex full-information maximum-likelihood and fully modified estimators when the processes are weakly exogenous [...] Importantly, if weak exogeneity is not a reasonable assumption, the single-equation GECM will be both biased and inefficient and \emph{t} tests based on the model parameters will be highly misleading.''

\citet[186]{Durr1992}: ``In general terms, error correction models (or ECMs) are appropriate when a priori theory dictates that the dependent variable under analysis exhibits short-term changes in response to changes in the independent variable(s) as well as long-term levels consistent with those of the independent variable(s).''

\citet[161]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe} (1) pre-test for order of integration (use unit root tests). Use: Dickey-Fuller, Aug DF, KPSS, variance ratio test. (2) find the cointegrating vector, and for that, regress the Y on the X, and see whether epsilon_hat is stationary (if it is, the two variables are cointegrated). (3) To test if epsilon_hat is stationary, regress e_t = alpha*e_t-1 + Z_t. If alpha =/= 0, e is NON-stationary, and hence both X and Y are NOT conintegrated (and move to VAR). If alpha = 0, is stationary, stationary. To test whether alpha = 0, use DF & AugDF, but do use non-standard tables (since it's an estimation of an estimation). (4) Estimate an ECM. 

\citet[354]{Enders2014}: ``speed of adjustment parameters. The larger [the speed of adjustment parameter] is, the greater the response of [the lagged values of Y] to the previous period's deviation from long-run equilibrium.

	\citet[1183-1184]{Krause1997} proposes a Wald test: ``Instead of using the commonly prescribed ADF cointegration test on the residuals [...] a more powerful alternative test set forth by \citet{Banerjee1993} is employed. This test specifically is centered on solving for a static long-run equation generated from a dynamic regression among these nonstationary variables in levels to see whether the long-run coefficients are jointly zero. If the Wald joint-test statistic for the long-run coefficients is significantly different from zero [...] then it can be stated that a cointegrating vector exists and an appropriate error correction mechanism (ECM) that takes into account long-run relationships should be incorporated into each of the model specifications.''

	% computing the long-run equilibrium

the betas associated to the ECM term, represent the speed of adjustment parameter (\citet[162-163]{Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe}). ``one or all of these terms should be statistically significant - otherwise, the ECM reduces to a VAR in first differences with no error correction process present. If none of the estimates are statistically significant, one should revert to a VAR in first differences because no cointegration is apparent in the data. Second, the estimates of the adjustment parameters will take on opposite signs. Intuitively, if each variable responds to long-run disequilibrium in the same direction, the system would remain in disequilibrium.''

\citet[14]{Haber2011}: ``turn to the ECM parameters for the five cases where we can reasonably reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration. Specifically, we focus on the long-run multiplier (LRM — the total effect that an increase in Fiscal Reliance has on Polity, spread over future time periods) for each of these five cases. If these countries are cursed the LRM should be negative, statistically significant, and of large magnitude.''

It is particularly useful in cases where standard cointe- gration tests (that do not allow for breaks) lead to the finding of no cointegration. The problems with standard cointegration tests in the presence of breaks were carefully illustrated by Gregory et al. (1996). A break introduces spurious unit root behaviour in the cointegrating relationship so that the hypothesis of no cointegration is difficult to reject.

% abstract
State-building scholars emphasize the role of economic development as a prerequisite of state-capacities. However, the origins of early economic growth are not clear. This paper explains its origins. I argue that inter-sectoral conflicts caused important economic structural transformations that altered the post-colonial balance of political power. In the early 20th century Latin America, there existed a sectoral interdependence between the agricultural and industrial sectors. Since the process of modern economic development consisted of a land-driven wealth accumulation process, the agriculture's sectoral contribution to economic development consisted of freeing labor to the modern sector. Though economic development worked initially in a complementary fashion, in the long run, it accelerated the agricultural sector's relative decay. That is, the more productive and strong the traditional sector was, the more it helped to create an even stronger industrial class, altering the original balance of political power. I argue that this structural transformation endangered the political leverage the agricultural sector had inherited from the colonial period. Hence, the emergence of the industrial class not only transformed the national economy in their respective countries, but also helped to create states of higher capacities. I employ cointegration techniques, such as vector error correction equations and Granger causality tests to examine the long-run effect of agricultural development on industrial development. 

% framing
	
	Frame the paper in the modernization theory, and how it fails to explain democratization. MOD TH: Dem <- Ind ; however, where does industrialization come from? why did agricultural labor participation decline? KEEP THINKING ABOUT THIS IDEA.

	\citet[288]{Jorgenson1967} argues that there exists a ``well-established empirical association between the degree of industrialization and the level of economic development.'' In turn, modernization theorists argue that industrialization is associated to democracy (\citet[]{Lipset,Lipset:1981uq}). Though I find that industrialization \emph{is} associated to democratization, I disagree with the channel of this causal path. Industrialization is spuriously associated with democratization since industrialization necessarily required the declining of the landowning class, an issue systematically ignored by the literature. This structural transformation did not bring incomes higher nor did improve education levels. Democratization was rather product of an inter-elite economic disequilibrium. Building on the `structural economics' framework and the `balanced growth' theory, I argue that economic development consists of the transference of labor from an efficient agricultural sector to an incipient industrial sector. An efficient agricultural sector made foodstuff cheaper, accelerating the development of the non-agricultural sector. However, the most important sectoral contribution to economic development of the landowning class consisted of freeing labor to the modern sector. The more productive and strong the traditional sector was, the more it helped to create an even stronger industrial class. Industrial development altered the original political balance the agricultural sector had inherited since colonial periods and had enjoyed throughout the early 19th century. This is what caused democracy, not higher incomes. 

	% this is the framing - still use the modernization part as an alternative hypothesis that doesn't work.
	--> Another way to frame the paper: Recent literature stresses that inter-elite competition is associated to the endogenous emergence of democratic regimes. However, it is not clear what the origins of this sectoral conflict are. This paper presents an argument etc. 

	(1) I study the complementarity between the development of the two sectors, and how industrialization accelerated the relative decay of the agricultural class by using time-series econometric methods such as Granger causality tests. 

	(2) I also present evidence on how democracy was not a function of the rate of industrialization, but rather % KEEP THINKING ABOUT THIS.

In such a favorable politico-economic environment, an initially large and growing agricultural surplus can serve as the principal means of getting industrial (and general) development under way.'' % That is NO HIRED WORKERS (p. 11).

  		\citet[281]{Johnston1966}: ``One of the most basic interrelationships between the two sectors arises from agriculture's role in provisioning the non-farm population [...] the terms of trade on which the non-agricultural population is able to obtain its food supplies will depend upon the rate of increase in a country's `agricultural surplus' relative to the growth of demand for purchased food. Failure of food supplies to expand sufficiently will lead to sharp increases in food prices that put a brake on industrial expansion. This vitally important `contribution' of the agricultural sector has been frequent emphasized.''

  		% food price // depends on the type of agriculture: rice vs wheat // labor intensity
  		\citet[345]{Vollrath2011}: ``The essential point is that the labor intensity in the agricultural sector determines the trade-off between consuming manufactured goods and having children, reflected in the relative price of food. Comparing the two crops, rice’s high labor intensity means that the amount of food that must be sacrificed to acquire one unit of manufacturing goods is large when compared with low labor-intensity wheat. For that reason the relative price of food tends to be smaller in rice-producing economies.'' % He emphasizes that greography is NOT the ultimate motor of growth (p. 347).

  \citet[324]{Jorgenson1961}: ``To study the development of a dual economy [implies] an agricultural surplus [that] eventually emerges so that development of an advanced sector is possible.'' This links up with \citet[]{Leibenstein:1957aa} and his ``minimum effort'' theory, where he argued that ``to achieve sustained economic growth something like a massive infusion of capital is required'' (\citet[289]{Jorgenson1967}). However, \citet[327]{Jorgenson1961} says that his own theory does not need a `minimum effort', as the theory  ``[works in] the absence of a critical ``minimum effort'' necessary for take-off into sustained growth.''

  		\citet[283]{Johnston1966}: ``The increased output of the non-agricultural sector affects agriculture in two principal ways. First, as economic development proceeds, the expansion of farm output comes to depend increasingly on the availability, improved design, and reduced cost of farm machinery and other inputs purchased from industry.

Generally, agriculture becomes increasingly efficient with high levels of total factor productivity and high rates of growth of productivity.''

  \citet[94]{Leibenstein:1957aa}: ``in order to achieve sustained secular growth, in the general case, it is necessary that the initial stimulant or stimulants to development be of a certain critical minimum size.''

It seems clear that this sector must also grow if the mechanism he describes is not to grind to a premature halt.'' \citet[2]{Nicholls1963} also thinks that it should be a balanced growth, and gives importance to the constant supply of food.

This demand comes only to a small proportion of the population of such countries. It comes to a greater extent from all other classes, of whom the farmers are far and away the largest category. If capital is being put into developing manufacturing industry while a country's agriculture remains stagnant, the result is bound to be distress in the manufacturing sector, as factory and cottage workers compete for a limited demand. But if there is balanced development, with the productivity of the farmers growing rapidly, and the demand for manufactures correspondingly increasing, there is ample scope for investment in industry [...] The secret pf most development problems is to maintain a proper balance between sectors.''

    		\citet[282]{Johnston1966}: ``With the expansion of the non-farm sector as structural transformation takes place, the domestic market becomes an increasingly important component of the demand for agricultural products. Inasmuch as expension of the non-farm population starts from a small base, the percentage increase in the market for purchased food is initially very rapid.''

For example, suppose that there is considerable innovation in the agricultural sector producing food for the home market. The result is either a surplus of food to sell to the towns, or a surplus of labour in agriculture seeking non-agricultural employment, or some combination of both. If manufacturing industry is growing simultaneously and at the right rate [which doesn't need to be the same rate, \citet[278]{Lewis:1965nr}], it can absorb both the surplus goods and the surplus labour. If it is not, the terms of trade will move against agriculture, and there will be a surplus of farm labour as well as farm products, agricultural incomes will be depressed, and further investment and innovation in this sector may be discouraged [...] Exactly the same difficulties arise if economic development is concentrated upon industrialization, to the neglect of agriculture, as happened in the U.S.S.R. There is then an acute shortage of agricultural products, and an inflation of their prices, which drives up all other prices in a spiral movement [...] If agriculture stagnates, the capitalist sector cannot grow [...] Smooth economic development requires that industry and agriculture should grow together.''

The `surplus' labour constitutes `hidden' or `disguised' unemployment.''

    			\citet[23-24]{Wellisz1968} explains that the problem is that ``the disguised-unemployment theorists are based (implicitly or explicitly) on the assumption that the out-migrants from the rural sector break all connections with the rural family and give up any claim to a share of the farm income. This assumption is not realistic.'' However, \citet{Sen1966b} explains that a number of important predictions made by the dual sector model do not need the assumption of `disguised unemployment' and/or `unlimited surplus of labor' to hold for the model to work.



    		\citet[39]{Kelley:1972zl}: Argue that this assumption is not critical ``the existence or nonexistence of disguised unemployment is neither a necessary nor a sufficient test of the appropriateness if the classical theory.'' \citet{Sen1966} makes this argument. READ. And \citet[]{Kuznets:1967aa} says that ``In any case, as Sen has shown, the existence or nonexistence of disguised unemployment is neither a necessary nor a sufficient test of the appropriateness of the classical theory.'' \citet[72]{Kelley:1972zl} argue that ``the `commercialization point' identified in the [\citet[]{Ranis1961}] model [...] is synonymous with the elimination of disguised unemployment in agriculture.'' \citet[40]{Leibenstein:1957aa} argues that among a number of economic characteristics of underdeveloped areas exist. First, there is an `absolute over-population', ``that is, it would be possible to reduce the number of workers in agriculture and still obtain the same total output.'' Second, there is ``[e]vidence of considerable `disguised unemployment' and a lack of employment opportunities outside agriculture.''

    			\citet{Oshima1958} criticizes \citet[]{Leibenstein1957}, arguing that ``The relevant characteristics of Asian agriculture are high labor intensity, small average size of holdings, and extreme seasonality [...] Labor requirements for maximum production typically exceed the adult, male working population by a wide margin, so that during peak periods, when the plowing, planting, and harvesting of the rice crop must be done, the labor of females, the young and the aged must be enlisted. It is partly for this reason that the labor-force participation rates of women and children in Asia are considerably higher than those of Latin-American countries [where] [e]excess population does not appear to be a problem.''

The industrial workers will want more food; the factories will want labour from the countryside; the expanding market of the farmers will be needed to take up the output of consumer goods; or alternatively the savings or taxed of the farmers will be needed to finance industrial construction. Similarly, if agriculture is expanding, it will need a growing industry, to absorb its product and its labour, and to provide the farmers with more consumer and capital goods [...] Balanced growth means not equal growth, but growth in the proportions dictated by the different rates of growth of demand.''

    		% Engel's Law
    		%\citet[115]{Ranis:1964uq}: once a portion of the labor has migrated to the modern sector, ``[a smaller] percent of the labor force in industry must produce a much larger output of industrial goods, since demand for these goods becomes increasingly responsive to per capita income change, while agricultural output needs to expand much less, mainly in response to population growth. The reallocation of labor thus becomes necessary because, with time, consumers want relatively more industrial goods and relatively fewer agricultural goods, which is the essence of Engel's law.''

	 		  \citet[9]{Fisher1935}: ``In the next, the secondary or industrial stage, manufactures and trade become relatively much important.

		\citet[567]{Johnston1961}: ``The importance of this process of structural transformation and the size of the related capital demands place a great burden on agriculture to provide capital for expansion of other sectors. The economic transformation also has important implications with respect to the changing role of labor and capital and the choice of methods for developing agriculture.''

		\citet[40]{Ranis:1964uq}: ``The various economic functions which must be carried out in a growing society may thus viewed as links in the chain of development [...] The first such link may be called the `labor allocation link' since it is concerned with the workings of the inter-sectoral labor market [...] the economy's ability to reallocate its redundant agricultural labor force for productive employment elsewhere [...] the more obvious reason that the availability of a plentiful supply of labor is a prerequisite for the expansion of the industrial sector.''

		% mechanisms of structural transformation.
		\citet[567]{Johnston1961}: ``\emph{Secular decline of the agricultural sector: the `general transformation model'}. The two basic factors generally recognized as responsible for the structural transformation of an economy are: (1) an income elasticity of demand for food that is less than 1 and declining, and (2) the possibility of a substantial expansion of agricultural production with a constant or declining farm labor force. A third factor that has received less attention is probably of considerable importance: by and large modern technology permits the most drastic reduction of costs in manufacturing industry, in power generation, and in long-distance transport. It is within these fields that investments in modern, power-driven machinery and the application of advanced technology lead to early and revolutionary reductions in costs so that price-elasticity and substitution effects reinforce differential income elasticities in changing the pattern of output and consumption.''\footnote{Italics in the original.}

		% decline in agriculture

% On exogenous "push"

	% technical progress is NOT needed.

Similarly, \citet{Johnson2017} find that the link between state capacities and economic growth is conditional on several factors (population size, culture, population homo(hetero)geneity, among others). However, in my account, the role of the income tax is conditioned on the degree of intersectoral conflicts, which I measure via the size of the industrial sector.

% Industrial/Agricultural Wage Differentials // Urban-City Migration

	% Harris–Todaro model: Definition FROM WIKIPEDIA!
		In the model, an equilibrium is reached when the expected wage in urban areas, is equal to the marginal product of an agricultural worker. unemployment is non-existent in the rural agricultural sector. As a result, the agricultural rural wage is equal to agricultural marginal productivity. In equilibrium, the rural to urban migration rate will be zero since the expected rural income equals the expected urban income. However, in this equilibrium there will be positive unemployment in the urban sector. 

		Therefore, migration from rural areas to urban areas will increase if: (1) Urban wages increase in the urban sector, increasing the expected urban income. (2) Agricultural productivity decreases, lowering marginal productivity and wages in the agricultural sector, decreasing the expected rural income. Rural to urban migration causes overcrowding and unemployment in cities as migration rates exceed urban job creation rates, with many people ending up in unproductive or underproductive employment in the informal sector. However, even though this migration creates unemployment and induces informal sector growth, this behavior is economically rational and utility-maximizing in the context of the Harris–Todaro model.

		\citet{Todaro1969}: Starts by criticizing the `one-stage' rural-urban migration, proposing a `two-stage' model. ``The first state finds the unskilled rural worker migrating to an urban area and initially spending a certain period of time in the so-called `urban traditional' sector. The second stage is reached with the eventual attainment of a more permanent sector job.''

		The structural transformation affected the labor structure as well. In fact, \citet[134-135]{Harris1970} explain that while ``the creation of an additional job in the urban area reduces agricultural output through induced migration,'' the opposite is not true.\footnote{See also \citet[280]{Johnston1966}.} This implies that agriculture-industry productivity differentials ``may even increase with development.''\footnote{\citet[110]{Kelley:1972zl}.} 

		\citet[464]{Ghosh2007}: ``Wage differentials across sectors are therefore also accompanied by effort differentials across sectors. Changes in effort levels as labour moves between sectors can produce much larger gains from intersectoral resource reallocations accompanying growth.'' % They're saying that BESIDES wage differentials being an explanation for inter-sectoral labor transference, wages also explain `effort', and hence `productivity.'

		% reasons to migrate.
		\citet[247]{Kelley:1972zl}: ``Central to the Lewis, Fei-Ranos, and Jorgenson models is the hypothesis that the current wage differential causes labor to transfer between sectors [...] It is widely recognized, however, that the current wage differential is not the only determinant of migration, and that all determinants are not necessarily economic. Other variables suggested include expected income or wages, costs of migration, age, education, information, urbanization, population density, and distance. We shall assume that the decision to migrate is based upon the difference between the income differential expected to prevail in the forthcoming period and the costs of migration - that is that the aggregate rate of migration is an increasing monotonic function of the expected net income differential.''

		\citet[139]{Todaro1969}: ``the decision to migrate from rural to urban areas will be functionally related to two principal variables: (1) the urban-rural real income differential and (2) the probability of obtaining an urban job.'' 

			\citet[4]{Fields1975} argues that the model does not generate the expected empirical outcomes.

			\citet[3]{Fields1975} explains the Harris-Todaro model: ``The model treats rural-urban migration primarily as an economic phenomenon[:] workers compare the expected incomes in the urban sector with agricultural wage rates and migrate if the former exceeds the latter.''

		\citet[13]{Ranis:1964uq}: ``The major problem of the dualistic economy, in fact, consists in the reallocation of such redundant and `parasitic' portions of the labor force into alternative employment where they are able to make a positive contribution to total output.''

		%\citet[46]{Kuznets1961a}: ``A given sector makes a contribution to an economy when it provides opportunities for other sectors to emerge.''

		\citet[16]{Ranis:1964uq}: ``the role of the industrial sector [...] is essentially related to the expansion of employment opportunities required for the absorption of the surplus labor force released by the agricultural sector and tantamount to a gradual expansion of the industrial productive capacity and output.''

		\citet[469]{Capasso2012}: ``migration flows and intersectoral wage differentials can affect the speed of labour readjustment between sectors.''

		% reasons to NOT migrate
		\citet[338]{Brueckner1999}: ``urban land-rent escalation provides an additional limiting force that constrains migration.''
 
	% assumptions of the Harris-Todaro Model
	\citet[65]{Calvo1978}: ``countries where there is a sector (urban sector) with an above-equilibrium minimum wage, side by side with another (rural sector) in which wages are determined by competitive forces. The urban sector is characterized by the fact that the unemployed workers of that sector have a positive probability of getting a job there, thus giving rise to search unemployment which equilibrium level is determined by the assumption that job seekers will migrate to the urban sector until expected wage in the latter is equalized to the rural wage. One of the crucial assumptions of that model is the existence of an exogenously determined (and binding) minimum wage in the urban sector.''

Finally, it is important to say that ``the agricultural sector declines relative to the overall economy but continues to expand absolutely.''\footnote{\citet[14]{Nerlove1994}.} In other words, it is the ``the proportional contribution of agriculture to the growth''\footnote{\citet[45]{Kuznets1961a}.} that decays, implying that in the long run the agricultural sector ``must also grow,''\footnote{\citet[534]{Ranis1961}.} especially given the continuing dependence on a constant supply of food.\footnote{\citet[2]{Nicholls1963}.} Consequently, balanced growth does not imply `equal' growth, but rather a long-run inter-sectoral dependence.


% social transformations
Dixit in \citet[328]{Mirrlees1973a}: ``With these transformations come important social and economic changes. Increased urbanisation brings about increased commercialisation of economic activities, which is made possible by increased monetisation. This promotes development of capital markets, and allows easier intersectoral movements of savings. There is more transport activity. All these factors lead to an increase in the share of services in national product''.

% Assumptions

	\citet[p. 450]{Temple2005}: ``The first key assumption is that the urban wage is fixed above the market-clearing level, perhaps for institutional reasons such as minimum wage legislation or the presence of a trade union. This results in unemployment''. ``The second key assumption is that workers will migrate between sectors unless expected utility is the same in each sector.''

	% it seems that the wages don't go up in the ind sector b/c there is an EXCESS of labor in the rural sector. And hence, it costs ZERO to attract that rural labor. 
		%\citet[]{Ranis:1964uq}: ``the existence of a pool of \emph{redundant} agricultural workers constitutes a potential source of labor supply for the industrial sector, preventing a rise in the industrial real wage.''\footnote{Emphasis is mine.}

		% rise in income is associated to transference of labor AGR -> IND
		  \citet[77]{Kelley:1972zl}: ``Rising per capita incomes have generally been accompanied by a redistribution of the labor force from agriculture to industry and by an increase in the share of industrial output (in value terms) in gross national product.''

		  \citet[288]{Jorgenson1967}: ``High income per head is associated with a relatively large proportion of the total population engaged in industry. Low income per head is associated with a predominance of employment in the agricultural sector.''

		  \citet[288]{Jorgenson1967}: ``The process of economic development may be studied as an increase in income per head or as an increase in the role of industrial activity relative to that in agriculture.''

       \citet[279]{Johnston1966}: ``A necessary condition for this modernization process is the structural transformation where - by an increasing proportion of the economically active population comes to be engaged in the production of the wide array of goods and services other than foodstuffs that become important in societies with comparatively high per capita incomes.''

       \citet{Kuznets1957} finds a negative correlation between the agricultural sector and income, and a positive correlation between the industrial sector and income. Services did not have an effect on incomes.

       \citet{Laitner2000}: ``When incomes are low, agriculture tends to be relatively important.''

		%Dixit in \citet[p. 325]{Mirrlees1973a}: ``Dual economy models provide a significantly better description and understanding of the problems of development than any aggregative model, not because two sectors are better than one (several economists including me seem to have grave doubts on that point), but because the sectoral division chosen reflects several vital social and economic distinctions in the type of economy being analyzed''.

		\citet[170]{Streeten1959}: ``Balanced growth has a horizontal and a vertical aspect. It implies a balance between, say, shoes, food, and clothing, but also between agricultural raw materials and manufacturing production, between capital goods and consumers' goods, between public utilities and other investment, between exports and production for the home market, \&c. The case for balanced growth rests upon the relation of complementarity between wants, between factors, and between factors and products at various stages of production.''

		% definition of `traditional sector'

Numerous definitions are available, but typically this refers to a sector of production that is predominantly rural, is limited by some fixed resource (e.g. land), is engaged in subsistence rather than commercial production, and is demonstrably poorer than the `modern' sector. In the work that follows I will use the term `agricultural' to refer to a sector that is generally rural and that relies heavily on certain fixed factors of production such as land. I will use the terms `modern' or `manufacturing' to refer to the sector that is generally urban and commercially oriented.'' % Make the argument that LA did have commercial agriculture.

In Japan the traditional sector includes agriculture, small manufacturing and most construction; the advanced sector should be identified with Japanese heavy industry'' (\citet[311]{Jorgenson1961}).

			\citet[47]{Ohkawa1960}: ``Japanese agriculture grew in harmony with the other sectors of the economy. In so doing, agriculture made a necessary contribution to rapid industrialization and urbanization.''\footnote{However, his theory ``assume[s] all the agricultural land is directly cultivated by \emph{self-employed }tillers.''

	%\citet[280]{Johnston1966}: ``The reality found in most underdeveloped countries approximates this dichotomy between agriculture and non-agriculture sufficiently, so that clear understanding of the process of economic development and of agriculture's role in the process must take account of this `dual' character of their economies.''

Despite this, the agricultural sector expanded in terms of cultivated area and production and also saw a remarkable increase in labour productivity, which can be illustrated with data for the main crops, cereals.

	% Lewis Model: process
	\citet[568]{Johnston1961}: ``The two-sector classical growth model. The implications of the dynamic nature of the growth process have been elaborated most clearly in W. Arthur Lewis' two-sector model, which represents a special case of the `general transformation model' [...] Since, in densely populated countries, a considerable proportion of the rural labor force may provide an increment to production less than the requirements for its own subsistence, Lewis assumes in his model that there is a surplus of manpower in agriculture [...] and that the nonagricultural [...] sector is the dynamic element which absorbs this surplus of manpower. Since the supply of labor available in the traditional sector is assumed to be in effect `unlimited,' the transfer of manpower to the capitalist sector is determined by the demand for labor in that sector, which in turn is limited by the rate of capital accumulation. In the capitalist sector it will normally be necessary to pay a wage determined by the average product per man in the traditional sector, plus some margin dictated by transfer frictions, social views of minimum subsistence, trade union pressure, and other institutional forces. This is, of course, a transitional phase. `When capital catches up with labour supply,' as Lewis phrases it, the two-sector model is no longer relevant.''

	% labor transference is perfectly elastic
	\citet[575-576]{Johnston1961}: ``To the extent that the Lewis two-sector model with its assumption of a perfectly elastic supply of labor is applicable, it follows that manpower for manufacturing and other rapidly expanding sectors can be drawn easily from agriculture. On the other hand, if the rural population is sparse and there is a good potential for expanding output of profitable cash crops, it may be difficult to obtain labor for a rapidly expanding capitalist sector. In any event, the bulk of the labor for the expanding sectors must be drawn from agriculture in the earlier stages of development simply because there is almost no other source.''

		% labor transference depends on industrial capital 
		\citet[96]{Ranis:1964uq}: ``the rate of labor absorption depends on the rapidity of the rate of capital accumulation in the industrial sector of the dualistic economy as well as on the strength and character of innovational activities [...] these two forces do not, in fact, occur in isolation from each other but are intertwined (for example, capital accumulation may be asked to `carry' technological change).''

		% labor transference depends on barriers to accumulation of capital
		\citet[16]{Landon-Lane2005}: ``the decline in barriers to capital accumulation [account] for the large changes in the sectoral composition of employment.''

	%\citet[576]{Johnston1961}: ``\emph{Agriculture's contributions to capital formation} [...] is probably the most significant implication of Lewis' two-sector model in which the rate of capital formation determines the rate at which employment can be expanded in the capitalist, high-wage sector of the economy; and the rate of expansion of employment in the capitalist sector relative to the growth of the total labor force determines how soon the surplus of rural labor will be reduced to a point where wage levels are no longer depressed by the low level of productivity and earnings in the subsistence sector.''\footnote{Italics in original.}

There may consequentially exist considerable reluctance to expose himself to an unfamiliar discipline in an unfamiliar industrial environment.

			% army

			\citet[202]{Rosenstein-Rodan1943}: His model was the first one in linking underdevelopment and an ``agrarian excess [of] population.'' This assumption has been widely used by a number of authors, not only to refer to the agricultural-industrial dualism (\citet{Lewis1954}), but more generally, to distinguish between a subsistence pre-capitalist sector and a modern/capitalistic sector, which might or might not refer to the agriculture/industry dualism. For example, while \citet[291]{Jorgenson1967} explicitly mentions the agricultural and the industrial sectors, while \citet[1]{Cowling1966} talks about a pre-capitalist and an ``(undefined) sector.'' Other examples for the former are \citet[113]{Higgins1956}, \citet[40]{Ara1962}, \citet[2]{Ohkawa1964} and \citet[227]{Stiglitz1967}. % Lewis does say agr-ind (\citet[291]{Jorgenson1967}).

			% definition of disguised unemployment.
			%\citet{Robinson1936} introduced the concept of `disguised unemployment.' Though it was firstly used in `structural' terms by \citet{Rosenstein-Rodan1943}, the concept was popularized by \citet{Lewis1954} who employed this term in `development' terms to signify \emph{redundant labor force} (\citet[203]{Ranis:1964uq} and \citet[289]{Jorgenson1967}). \citet[225]{Nurske:1961qr} points out that the concept ``is commonly used to denote all types of rural unemployment.'' According to \citet[102-103]{Leibenstein1957}, the idea is that ``there is excess of labor where the existing labor supply could cultivate more land without loss of efficiency.''

			\citet[102]{Leibenstein1957}: ``The essential part of the argument is that, where the amount of work put forth is related to the wage, landlords can improve their position by employing excess labor rather than by employing the `optimum' amount of labor and permitting the unemployed to drive wages down. If wages are driven down, they may reach a level at which the amount of work done is so reduced that the landlords' net revenue decreases.'' % Essentially, he's saying that MORE/OPTIMAL FOOD --> MORE PRODUCTIVITY. So, the same level of food, i.e. income, but also improving productivity by employing disguised/excess employment: the same people, earning the same wages/food, but working less.

			%\citet[21]{Ohkawa1961}: ``It is self-evident that without increasing food output, capitalist sector must remain in a stationary state.''

			%\citet[730]{Fields2004}: ``An important feature of the Lewis model is that there was no open unemployment, only underemployment.''
	
		\citet[p. 468]{Temple2005}: ``The attractiveness of 
		(1970) as an organizing framework is limited by the assumption of a fixed urban wage.''

		%\citet[730]{Fields2004}: ``as a labor surplus existed, economic growth would generate intersectoral shifts of employment but little or no increase in real wages in the formal sector.''

		\citet[p. 126]{Harris1970}: assume ``the existence of a politically determined minimum urban wage at levels substantially higher than agricultural earnings.''


	% Harris–Todaro model explains...
	
		\citet[p. 450]{Temple2005}: Harris–Todaro model ``can explain why rural-urban migration persists even in the face of high urban unemployment''

		\citet[11]{Kelley:1972zl}: ``one of the most important aspects of economic development is the migration of capital and labor. The movement of factors from sectors of low productivity is one of the primary means by which economic progress takes place.''

		\citet[p. 129]{Harris1970}: ``The essence of our argument is that in many developing nations the existence of an institutionally determined urban minimum wage at levels substantially higher than that which the free market would allow can, and usually does, lead to an equilibrium with considerable urban unemployment. In our model migration is a disequilibrium phenomenon.''

		\citet[252]{Kelley:1972zl} argues that \citet{Harris1970} think that ``it is more realistic to consider labor migration in a low-income economy as a two-stage process. In the first stage, the unskilled rural worker migrates to an urban area and initially spends a period of time in the `urban traditional' sector. The second stage is reached when the migrant obtains a more permanent job in the modern sector. In Harris and Todaro's view the decision to migrate from rural to urban areas is a function of the urban-rural differential in real income and the probability of obtaining urban employment. This it is the `expected' income differential rather than the prevailing real income differential that is the relevant determinant of migration [...] migration is still viewed as an equilibrium process in their model, since labor migration continues in each period until the expected income differential is zero.''

		\citet[p. 127]{Harris1970}: ``the continued existence of rural-urban migration in spite of substantial overt urban unemployment represents an economically rational choice on the part of the individual migrant''

	
		\citet[p. 451]{Temple2005}: ``because the improvement in urban prospects generates extra rural-urban migration. This gives rise to the ``Todaro paradox'', when employment creation is not accompanied by any decline in urban unemployment.''

		\citet[p. 126]{Harris1970}: ``migration proceeds in response to urban-rural differences in \emph{expected} earnings [...] with the urban employment rate acting as an equilibrating force on such migration''\footnote{Emphasis in original.}.

		\citet[250]{Kelley:1972zl}: ``the laborer ascertains the expected wage differential by reference to past wage differentials about which he has complete knowledge.''  

		\citet[313]{Jorgenson1961a}: ``the differential which is necessary to cause movement of agricultural labor force into the industrial sector is roughly proportional to the industrial wage rate.'' \citet[251]{Kelley:1972zl} supports this view.

	% further equilibrium // implications

		%\citet[730]{Fields2004}: one ``prediction is that once the unlimited supply of labor is exhausted and the turning point is reached, subsequent economic growth is marked by rising real wages economy-wide.''

		\citet[p. 132]{Harris1970}: ``The standard solution to the problem of an institutionally determined wage that is higher than the equilibrium level is to employ labor in the public sector.''

		% expansion of the urban sector, kills the traditional sector: STRUCTURALLY PROTECTED
		%\citet[p. 134-135]{Harris1970}: ``While the creation of an additional job in the urban area reduces agricultural output through induced migration, additional employment can be generated in the agricultural sector without reducing manufacturing output.''

		%\citet[110]{Kelley:1972zl}: ``It is also emphasized in the literature that [differentials in agriculture-industry productivity] may even increase with development.'' 
		%For example, \citet{Serrano2016} find that there has been a declining role of agricultural exports around year 2000. % Though they find that decline in agriculture is not related to national economic development, but to exogenous international forces. However, they do document this decline. 


	\citet[LEER]{Brueckner199}: ``consider a version of the Harris-Todaro model in which land rents play an equilibrating role. Migration to the city raises the cost of urban living by driving up rents, and this effect limits the migration response to an improvement in urban productivity'' (in \citet[p. 451]{Temple2005}).

		% what explains decision to migrate between sectors, also explains intra-sector migration
		\citet{Fields1975}: presents a more generalized formulation of the job search process. He ``analyze[s] the equilibrium allocation of the labor force between labor market. [Their] premise is that the same kinds of forces that explain the choices of workers between the rural and urban sectors can also explain their choices between one labor market and another within an urban area.''

	 	\citet[571]{Johnston1961}: ``The most important ways in which increased agricultural output and productivity contribute to over-all economic growth can be summarized in five propositions: (1) Economic development is characterized by a substantial increase in the demand for agricultural products, and failure to expand food supplies in pace with the growth of demand can seriously impede economic growth. (2) Expansion of exports of agricultural products may be one of the most promising means of increasing income and foreign exchange earnings, particularly in the earlier stages of development. (3) The labor force for manufacturing and other expanding sectors of the economy must be drawn mainly from agriculture. (4) Agriculture, as the dominant sector of an underdeveloped economy, can and should make a net contribution to the capital required for overhead investment and expansion of secondary industry. (5) Rising net cash incomes of the farm population may be important as a stimulus to industrial expansion.''

	 %	citet[534]{Ranis1961}: Drawing on Lewis, they argue that ``Development consists of the re-allocation of surplus agricultural workers, whose contribution to output may have been zero or negligible, to industry where they become productive members of the labor force at a wage equal (or tied to) the institutional wage in agriculture.''

	 	\citet[539]{Ranis1961}: ``The `exhaustion of the labor surplus' must be interpreted primarily as a market phenomenon rather than as a physical shortage of manpower; it is indicated by an increase in the real wage at the source of supply.''

This process of labor reallocation must be sufficiently rapid to shift the economy's center of gravity from the agricultural to the industrial sector. As a first approximation, the center of gravity can be measured in terms of the \emph{percentage}\footnote{Emphasis in original.} of the total population or labor force active in each sector, and the shifting of the center of gravity toward industry must mean that the percentage of the total population or labor force allocated to that sector is increasing.''

As a very rough approximation, one might suppose these to expand in proportion to industry proper, and be absorbed in it for purpose of analysis''.

Lewis assumed ``(1) that technology can be divided in capital-using (capitalist) and non-capital-using (subsistence); (2) that the labor supply is elastic at a conventional wage; and (3) that saving is done largely by the recipients of nonwage income (capitalists).'' (\citet[311]{Chenery1975}).

			Though inter-elite conflicts can be expressed politically and militarily, inter-sectoral contestation itself is deeply rooted in a country's economy structure. However, the \emph{origins} of this inter-sectoral (im)balance (expressed in sectoral output differentials in \autoref{fig:incometax}) reflect structural economic dynamics between the two sectors that cause them to compete over a limited supply of labor, specifically urban labor\footnote{\citet[67-68]{Enzo-Faletto:1979ty}. As \citet[318]{Matsuyama1992} puts it, ``the manufacturing sector has to compete with the agriculture sector for labor. Low productivity in agriculture implies the abundant supply of ``cheap labor'' which the manufacturing can rely on''. See also \citet[160]{Gollin2002}.}. For the modern sector to develop, the traditional sector had to decay\footnote{\citet[621-622]{Matsuyama1991} argues that the process of ``[i]ndustrialization [consists of] a shift of resources from agriculture to manufacturing''.}. \citet[642-643]{Matsuyama1991} explains that ``a takeoff is possible in an economy with less productive agriculture, while an economy with productive agriculture will be trapped into the state of preindustrialization''\footnote{\citet[293]{Skott1998} point out that ``an increase in the growth rate of agricultural productivity may reduce the rate of growth of real income under free trade''.}. That is, the process of industrialization is governed by the law of comparative advantages. The \hyperref[unpacking]{case study} below shows that the economic-structural dimension of inter-elite political contestation was true in Chile.\footnote{But see \citet{RoblesOrtiz2009}.} Moreover, these conditions apply to other Latin American economies as well. The sectoral conflict regarding the generation of income and its potential taxation has been studied elsewhere too.\footnote{See \citet[55]{Best1976}.} For example, \citet[]{Mares2015} examine how income taxation in Europe is associated with inter-elite conflicts, particularly between the landed elite and the industrial elite. For example, \citet[ 8]{Bash1986} explains that ``Colombia's two traditional political parties crystallized in the 1840's and reflected in many respects the dual nature of the Colombian economy.'' Taxation and state formation with a sector/class approach  has also been studied in Africa. For example, \citet{SanchezdelaSierra2014} studies the relationship between taxation and state formation in Eastern Congo, and how the interplay of different sectors fostered (or not) state-building processes.

			\citet[281]{Johnston1966}: ``The sectoral interdependence between agriculture and non-agriculture in a developing economy is complex and can be viewed in many ways. Here it will be analyzed in relation to (a) the supply of and effective demand for agricultural products, (b) the supply of and demand for non-agricultural products as they interact with agriculture, and (c) \emph{the competition between agriculture and non-agriculture for factors of production}.''\footnote{Emphasis is mine.}

After 1875, however, export agriculture entered a period of rapid decline, and by the early 1880' s the industry was in crisis. In 1885 Liberals lost control of politics to Conservatives, the liberal world view was repudiated, and a conservative political and economic philosophy consistent with Colombia's reversion to a relatively closed agrarian economy became dominant in Colombia''

% Unbalanced growth


\citet[]{Hirschman:1958aa} % Bought on Amazon.

	``Hirschman criticised [\citet{Lewis1954}] version of the balanced growth concept and said this is `essentially an exercise in retrospective comparative statics' in Chapter 4 of his book `The Strategy of Economic Devetopment' (New Haven, 1959). In my impression, [\citet{Lewis1954}] seems to disregard entirely the problem of backward sectors, where almost no automatic incentives can be expected in the balancing adaptation process of the economy.'' (in \citet[13]{Ohkawa1961}).


\citet{Rosenstein-Rodan1943} % I think he's unbalanced growth?



 % problems in aqcuiring the latest technology
    
        \citet[89, 93]{Baer1966}: ``The dynamic sector of the economy was not absorbing labor at a satisfactory rate [since] many developing countries were not adopting the most labor-intensive techniques possible.'' For example, in Chile ``there exists an excess of personnel employed in practically all factories studied.'' ('The Textile Industry in Latin America', ECLAC, in \citet[94]{Baer1966}).

        % better technologies require less manpower.
        %\citet[95-96]{Baer1966}: ``new equipment will necessarily involve more automation [and hence] modern machinery with a higher output will tend to reduce manpower absorption.'' (in \emph{The Textile Industry in Latin America}, p. 92)
        % my reading then is that technology has to be labor-using, not labor-saving too (that is, not only industry but also technology has to be labor-using). This is in line with Hirschman and the idea of unbalanced growth.

        	% requiring less manpower due to better technologies in the industrial sector is the SECOND STAGE PHASE in industrialization.
        	\citet[283]{Johnston1966}: ``when structural transformation has reached a point where the non-farm population is large relative to the agricultural population, investment in labor-saving machinery in agriculture becomes increasingly important.''


             % however, better technologies free labor for terciary/serives-type industries
             %\citet[506-507, 513]{Galenson1963}: ``Under conditions of modern technology [industrialization] is not likely to be that of a major source of new employment [...] countries in which manufacturing output grew most rapidly also experienced the largest increases in tertiary employment.''
             
             % he calls it the ¨multiplier¨ effects of industry:
             \citet[518]{Galenson1963}: ``It is not in the manufacturing sector [...] but in the tertiary sector, that the bulk of the new employment is likely to be located. This does not mean that there will be no new factory jobs, but rather that for every additional hundred workers in manufacturing there may well be a substantial multiple of this number added to the labour force in commerce, construction, transportation, and services, the actual multiple depending on the initial size of the manufacturing sector and its relative productivity.''

  % structural growth

  \citet[p. 318]{Matsuyama1992}: ``According to this view, the manufacturing sector has to compete with the agriculture sector for labor. Low productivity in agriculture implies the abundant supply of ``cheap labor'' which the manufacturing can rely on.''

  \citet[p. 326]{Matsuyama1992}: ``under the open economy assumption, the model predicts a negative link agricultural productivity and economic growth. In an economy with less productive agriculture, the manufacturing sector attracts more labor and, therefore, grows faster. On the other hand, the productive agriculture sector squeezes out the manufacturing sector, and the economy will de-industrialize over time''.

  \citet[p. 642-643]{Matsuyama1991}: ``a takeoff is possible in an economy with less productive agriculture, while an economy with productive agriculture will be trapped into the state of preindustrialization''. This is in line with the idea of ``unbalanced growth'': [from Wikipedia] ``Unequal development of various sectors often generates conditions for rapid development. More-developed industries provide undeveloped industries an incentive to grow.''

% argentina case


  - It seems that the export/import divide overlaps with the industrial/agricultural cleavage.
    \citet[23]{Diaz1966}: ``besides analyzing recent Argentine economic history in terms of industry vs. agriculture, it should also be discussed in terms of exportable and importable goods vs. home goods.''

    \citet[]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}: ``industry and industrialists failed to acquire the same status as agroexports. Policies were adopted to promote industry, but they were not always consistent.''

    \citet[25]{Diaz1966}: trade policy //  ``The terms of trade between rural and manufactured goods [refer] more directly, to domestic prices of rural products relative to the domestic prices of manufactured goods.''

    \citet[22]{Diaz1966}: ``The basic problem has not been one of' too much industry', but partly one of too few exports.''

    \citet[231]{Debowicz2014}: the political conflict involved ``conflict between exporting and import-competing sectors of the economy, making the question of industrial protection highly political.''

    \citet[25]{Diaz1966}: ``while the correspondence between exports and rural products, and between imports and manufactured goods has not been perfect during the years under discussion, such correspondence has been quite close.''

  \citet[231]{Debowicz2014}: the ``standard view of the impact of ISI: its effect on relative prices benefitted import-competing manufacturing at the expense of exporting agriculture [causing] a slowdown and relative decline in agriculture.''

  \citet[6]{ODonnell1978}: ``the state was an expression of changing power-relationships between regions directly incorporated in the world market and others marginal to it to a much smaller extent than in the rest of Latin America.''

  % answer: What's the origin of the Argentinean economic backwardness?
    % had backwards industrial development.
      \citet[209]{Campos2016}: ``There is little disagreement among economists that the period from 1875 to the eve of World War I is the Golden Age, or the Belle \'Epoque, of Argentinean economic history.''

      \citet[136]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}: ``The most developed country, Argentina, had a relatively backward industrial structure for a country of its income and wealth. Indeed, industrial labor productivity was lower than in Chile [...] despite Argentina's superior income per head.'' % See Table 5.3 (p. 134), specially value added by worker employed (several countries, Chile, Mexico, Colombia & Argentina).

      \citet[188]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}:  Among the factors that explain Argentina's failure was ``modest tariff protection, a social infrastructure geared to agroexports [and] a powerful rural elite.''

      \citet[142]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}: ``Although Argentina was the most industrialized of all the Latin American countries, its manufacturing sector was still smaller than what one might have expected from international comparisons.''

      \citet[188]{Bulmer-Thomas2003}: ``Argentine industry had not been particularly successful in meeting the enormous demand for manufactured goods derived from its rapid export growth.''

      \citet[142]{Bulmer-Thomas2003} ``The outstanding weakness of Argentine industrialization was in the textile and clothing sectors [and hence] highly specific and not due to some conspiracy on the part of the nation's landowners.''

    %There was too much of industry (as opposed to \citet[22]{Diaz1966}). 
    \citet[157]{Diaz1967}: ``the net effect of public policy was to twist further the domestic terms of trade against the rural sector and to discriminate in favour of 'home' or non-traded goods.''

    \citet[3]{Schmitz1984}: ``since credit for installing machinery was relatively cheap, factories were over-equipped.'' % this is not particularly ABOUT Argentina.

    %Policy was biased against the industrial sector, endangering all the assumptions of the dual sector mode.
    \citet[157]{Diaz1967}: ``These policies were implemented using a variety of tools: [...] government controls over marketing of rural produce, a policy of absolute protection for most, but not all, manufactured products [...] \emph{The discrimination against the rural sector was worse than that implied by data on relative prices}; during most of the period under study the rural sector found it very difficult to obtain either domestically or abroad certain types of inputs (fertilizers, tractors, etc.) which could conceivably have allowed it to react to the decline in the real prices for its output by increasing productivity [plus] very weak efforts by the government in the field of agricultural research and extension services.''\footnote{Emphasis is mine.}

    %immigration, and labor movement
    \citet[158]{Diaz1967}: ``Besides pleasing economic nationalists, such a policy had the additional advantage of generating employment for the urban working class, a political pillar of the regime ruling during 1943-55, while it also encouraged the migration from rural to urban areas which had been taking place since the nine- teen thirties.''

  % bias against export and agriculture
  \citet[3]{Schmitz1984}: There was a ``\emph{Bias against exports}. The existence of import restrictions led to a higher exchange rate than would have prevailed under a free trade regime, reducing the relative gains obtained from exporting [and] \emph{Bias against agriculture}. The protection of local industry raised the prices of manufactured goods relative to agricultural products in the home market and the overvalued exchange rate reduced the domestic currency receipts for agricultural exports.''\footnote{Emphasis in original.}

  % bias against utilization of labor

% Japan and UK had similar processes: high agricultural productivity, helped the industrial sector
\citet[507]{Johnston1951}: ``The increase of labor productivity in British agriculture played the same significant role which has been noted in the case of Japan - making available an abundant supply of cheap labor for the growing manufacturing industries.'' In the U.S.S.R. agriculture also helped to develop the industrial sector (508).


% in the US
\citet[3]{Landon-Lane2003}: ``in 1870 the USA had seventy percent of its labour force employed in agriculture. By 1900 this had halved, and by 1998, the proportion was just three percent.''

% in bolivia

The argument considers that agriculturalists had been a hegemonic group protected by practices inherited from institutions originated in colonial times, and that subsequent institutional investments reverted this situation causing long-term economic growth. However, others have argued that the independence wars around in the 1800's contributed to the collapse of all colonial institutions, including the privileges the landowning sector had. For example \citet[191]{Mahoney:2010aa} explains that the ``wars of independence were violent and destructive; they saw the collapse of the colonial fiscal system [...] and the elimination of the colonial political order.''\footnote{See also \citet[55]{Saylor:2014aa} and \citet[27-28, 35-36]{Lopez-Alves:2000zl}.} However, the collapse of a number of institutions does not necessarily mean the collapse of the legacies of \emph{the} colonial political economy. \citet[349]{Capoccia2007} argue that ``[e]ven where various institutions are interconnected, the occurrence of a critical juncture for one institution need not constitute a critical juncture with respect to all of its counterpart.'' I find in this paper that the landed elites did have privileges that the industrialists did not have \emph{because} of the inertia of colonial institutions. In fact, elsewhere I find that the implementation of the income tax was product of a series of inter-elite compromises that aimed to equate the political privileges of the two sectors, putting countries in a path of political development.\footnote{\citet{Bahamonde:2017ab}.} In this paper I focus on the intertwined relationship between political \emph{and} economic development.



While the process of state-building had started earlier\footnote{See for example \citet{Kurtz:2013aa} and \citet{Soifer:2016zr}.} the implementation of the income tax was an important building block in this process.




The income tax did not just contribute to the state in revenue, it did so by triggering other state institutions that generated long term \emph{political} development.\footnote{Humud (1969, p. 154) explains for the Chilean case that the income tax did generate considerable resources, and that ``1930 would become second only to import duties in size,'' in \citet[451-452]{Bowman1982}.} In this paper I expand on this idea by arguing that political institutions of state-building such as the income tax law set in motion a path of long-term \emph{economic} development. 



Analytically, I consider sectoral conflicts the spring of fiscal development, which in turn translates into economic development. 



While the agricultural sector dominated most of the economy, the landowning class controlled most of the politics.\footnote{See for the Chilean case \citet[13]{Zeitlin:1984aa}, \citet[45]{Bauer:2008kx}, \citet[1748]{Baland2008} and \citet[56]{Best1976}.} In turn, the lack of an economic challenger prevented political contestation and further institutional investments. However, 


The following \hyperref[dual:sector]{section} introduces the \emph{dual sector model}, where I explain the mechanics of industrial expansion and why it is relevant for political development. Next I present the Chilean and Argentinean \hyperref[case:studies]{cases} to illustrate the theory and to provide some historical context. The two cases exemplify different aspects of the argument. The Chilean case stresses the initial structural advantages the landowning sector had and the inter-sectoral competition aspects. The Argentinean case explains a recurrent issue in Latin American economic history, namely, whether the export-oriented and import-oriented sectors overlapped with the the agriculture/industry cleavage. Then, in an effort to suggest that this hypothesis could be generalized to other countries in Latin America, in the econometric \hyperref[methods]{section} I provide evidence of different vector autoregressive models (VAR), Granger-causality tests and impulse response functions (IRFs) for a subset of Latin American countries and explain why when there were economic structural transformations there were also sectoral political conflicts and subsequent investment in institutional capacities. Lastly, I provide some final \hyperref[discussion]{remarks}.\vfill
