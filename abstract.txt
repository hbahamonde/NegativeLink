I argue that the context in which countries implemented the income tax law, was a critical juncture, promoting (or undermining) long-term economic and political development. Leveraging the dual sector model of economic growth, and the fiscal sociology paradigm, I explain how balanced sectoral growth, and income taxation, promoted economic growth and state-building in the early 20th century Latin America. Since taxation affected landowners and industrialists in different ways, economic elites were divided on their preferences towards fiscal policy---and consequently---state centralization. In cases where the implementation of the income tax reflected this sectoral cleavage, the political incorporation of both sectors was more likely, expanding both state capacities and sustained balanced economic growth. In turn, balanced growth promoted higher levels of sectoral equality, precluding sectoral dominance on both sides. However, where the sectoral conflict was too weak to trigger the political incorporation of industrial political elites, institutions kept reproducing the post-colonial order that benefited the landowning class, compromising both state-building and economic development. My empirical strategy leverages economic history data since the 1900s for a number of Latin American countries, time-series analyses, and the Chilean case during the 1920s to contextualize the causal mechanism.
