While virtually all countries in Latin America imposed the income tax, the policy only fostered state development when it was implemented under circumstances of fast industrial expansion. However, when implemented under slow agricultural expansion, income taxation did not produce state-building. I argue that this context in which countries implemented the policy, was a critical juncture. Leveraging the dual sector model of economic growth, and the fiscal sociology paradigm, I explain how balanced inter-sectoral growth, and income taxation, promoted economic growth and state consolidation in the early 20th century Latin America. My empirical strategy leverages economic history data since the 1900s for a number of Latin American countries, time-series analyses, and the Chilean case during the 1920s to contextualize the causal mechanism.
