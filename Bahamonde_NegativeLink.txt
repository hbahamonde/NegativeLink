    The paper proposes an alternative channel to explain the occurrence of
    political and economic development in Latin America. Historically,
    agriculturalists had been a hegemonic group protected by institutions
    that originated in colonial times. These norms had survived due to
    institutional inertia, perpetuating their advantaged position. Building
    on the fiscal sociology and dual sector models I argue that a structural
    transformation marked by a secular decline of agriculture and
    substantial expansion of manufacturing helped political development by
    promoting the emergence of an industrial political elite.
    Industrialization altered the status quo not by increasing incomes (*á
    la* modernization theory) but by supporting the rise of a political
    challenger. Importantly, the structural transformation required both
    sectors to grow in a balanced fashion, leveling both elites in their
    relative political and military capacities. Under egalitarian conditions
    to engage in conflict, there were no incentives to make war, and thus
    conflict was avoided generating a status of inter-sectoral cooperation.
    I use the Chilean and Argentinean cases to illustrate the theory. In an
    effort to suggest that this hypothesis could be generalized to other
    countries in Latin America, I provide a number of time series analyses
    (VAR models, impulse response functions and Granger-causality tests) for
    a dataset spanning approximately 100 years on agricultural and
    industrial sectoral growths.

    **Structural Transformations and State Institutions in Latin America,
    1900-2010**

Sectoral Conflicts and Development
==================================

The literature on the relationship between political and economic
development is vast. Without trying to survey all of it, there seems to
be an agreement in that strong institutions cause better economic
performance. For example @North:1990vl [3] asserts that the idea that
“institutions affect the performance of economies is hardly
controversial.” Most of the explanations focus on institutional
constraints and property rights.[^2] When property rights are secured
via the state[^3] or social norms,[^4] there will be incentives to
invest in infrastructure, research and development.[^5] This is usually
the case when political and military elites are constrained by
institutions such as constitutions and parliaments.

This paper contributes to this literature by adding an alternative
channel. Particularly, it complements our understanding of political and
economic development from the sectoral conflict framework, specifically
by (re)introducing and empirically testing the *dual sector economy
model*. The political development literature has traditionally focused
on socio-economic cleavages and potential alliances between a
*homogeneous* ruling elite and politically excluded segments of the
society, traditionally peasants or other disenfranchised groups such as
the bourgeoisie. @Moore:1966tn, @Tilly:1992rr, @Boix:2003db,
@Stasavage:2008fr and @Acemoglu:1996rm are among the most prominent
examples supporting this view.[^6] In this paper I focus on political
divisions *among* the elite. This sectoral approach is hardly new. Just
to mention some examples, @Guillermo-ODonnell:1986ul emphasized the
positive impact of elite outsiders on democratic transitions,
@Ansell:2014ty and @Boix:2015aa argue about the role of economic
inequality/equality among the elite on political development,
@Waldner:1999aa studies how the formation of a modern state should
coincide with the incorporation of lower classes to produce
developmental states, while @Saylor:2014aa [8] looks at the “coalitional
basis of state building” and @Mares2015 examine how income taxation in
Europe is associated with inter-elite conflicts, particularly between
the landed elite and the industrial elite. While political economists
have already recognized the relevance of different economic and social
elites, the explicit study of the *structural economic inter-dependence*
of different sectors on political development has been overlooked. This
paper bridges this gap by bringing in the *dual sector economic model*.
This model is a theory of how industrialization occurs[^7] which by
emphasizing the importance of macro-structural transformations explains
the mechanics of economic growth. I link and empirically test the
association between macro-economic transformations, the emergence of a
disenfranchised industrial class with institutional development.

The crux of the argument is that an economic structural transformation
characterized by “a secular decline of agriculture and substantial
expansion of manufacturing”[^8] imposed tight constraints on the way
politics was run by the incumbent landowning class. An elite divided on
an *economic* cleavage should at the same time be divided on their
*political* preferences, particularly regarding their attitude towards
state centralization.[^9] State centralization affects landowners and
industrialists in a different way.[^10] Agriculturalists will
systematically resist taxation as land fixity increases the risk premium
of their main asset.[^11] In contrast, industrialists’ preferences
toward taxation are more elastic as capital can be reinvested in
nontaxable sectors.[^12] I argue that the emergence of an efficient and
productive industrial sector altered not only the structure of the
economy (causing *growth*) but also the inter-sectoral balance of
*political* power, making unsustainable the political monopoly run by
the landed elites enabled by institutionalized practices inherited from
the colonial period. Balanced inter-sectoral economic growth evened out
both elites, forcing them to seek political compromises. In this paper I
identify one such compromise, the income tax law, and explain how around
the 1920s income taxation contributed to form the Latin American state
by setting countries in a path of economic and political development.
Critically, the income tax had to be implemented in a situation when no
elite was more powerful than the other, and hence, in the presence of
inter-sectoral tensions and economic indeterminacy. Building on the
fiscal sociology paradigm, I have argued elsewhere that the
implementation of the income tax law triggered a series of
state-*building* institutions.[^13] While the process of state-building
had started earlier (@Kurtz:2013aa and @Soifer:2016zr) the
implementation of the income tax was an important building block in this
process. The faster the incipient industrial sector caught up with the
traditional elites, the higher the pressures to impose a tax to capture
increasing industrial incomes and to develop skilled bureaucracies to
administer and collect the tax. The income tax did not just contribute
to the state in revenue, it did so by triggering other state
institutions that generated long term *political* development. In this
paper I expand on this idea by arguing that political institutions of
state-building such as the income tax law set in motion a path of
long-term *economic* development. In sum, when the elite structure was
faint and the agricultural sector inefficient, by means explained in the
next , the emergence of the industrial sector was compromised or
delayed. I claim that in these situations landowners were never
challenged and there were less pressures to centralize the state, making
less likely further institutional investments.

The argument considers that agriculturalists had been a hegemonic group
protected by practices inherited from institutions originated in
colonial times, and that a modern strong industrial elite challenged
those privileges. However, others have argued that the independence wars
around the 1800s contributed to the collapse of all colonial
institutions, including the privileges the landowning sector had. For
example @Mahoney:2010aa [191] explains that the “wars of independence
were violent and destructive; they saw the collapse of the colonial
fiscal system \[...\] and the elimination of the colonial political
order.”[^14] However, the collapse of a number of institutions does not
necessarily mean the collapse of the legacies of *the* colonial
political economy. @Capoccia2007 [349] argue that “\[e\]ven where
various institutions are interconnected, the occurrence of a critical
juncture for one institution need not constitute a critical juncture
with respect to all of its counterpart.” Following their advice of
finding “the decision-making process, \[and\] identify\[ing\] which
decisions were most influential,” I find in this paper that the landed
elites did have privileges that the industrialists did not have
*because* of the inertia of colonial institutions, specially in Chile.
In fact, elsewhere I find that the implementation of the income tax was
product of a series of inter-elite compromises that aimed to equate the
political privileges of the two sectors, putting countries in a path of
political development.[^15] In this paper I focus on the intertwined
relationship between political *and* economic development.

The following introduces the *dual sector model*, where I explain the
mechanics of the emergence of the industrial sector and why it is
relevant for political development. Next I present the Chilean and
Argentinean to illustrate the theory and to provide some historical
context. The two cases exemplify different aspects of the argument. The
Chilean case stresses the initial structural advantages the landowning
sector had and the inter-sectoral competition aspects. The Argentinean
case explains a recurrent issue in Latin American economic history,
namely, whether the export-oriented and import-oriented sectors overlap
with the the agriculture/industry cleavage. Then, in an effort to
suggest that this hypothesis could be generalized to other countries in
Latin America, in the econometric I provide evidence of different vector
autoregressive models (VAR), Granger-causality tests and impulse
response functions (IRFs) for a subset of Latin American countries and
explain why when there were economic structural transformations there
were also sectoral political conflicts and subsequent investment in
institutional capacities. Lastly, I provide some final .

Structural Transformations and the Dual Sector Economy Model\[dual:sector\]
===========================================================================

The *dual sector* or *balanced growth* model argues that the economic
system is divided into two sectors loosely defined as ‘advanced or
modern sector’ or ‘manufacturing sector,’ and as ‘backward or
traditional sector,’ or ‘agriculture.’[^16] The basic intuition of this
paradigm is that in order for the industrial sector to develop, it needs
*first* an efficient and strong agricultural sector. Contingent on
efficient agricultural productivity, the emergence of the industrial
sector goes from a low-production sector eventually surpassing the
agricultural sector. If the agricultural sector lacks economic
efficiency, the industrial sector will hardly develop, leaving the
country in an economic trap. This literature is vast. While in this
section I explain the core of it, there are many current theoretical and
methodological applications and extensions to the dual sector
model.[^17] I claim that this model is relevant for political
development since it explains the rising of the industrial economic
sector which in turn nurtured the emergence of an industrial political
elite.

It was @Lewis:1965nr [151] who popularized the idea that “\[t\]he secret
of most development problems is to maintain a proper balance between
sectors.” The dual nature of the economy has been widely accepted and
forms part of “a long tradition in development economics.”[^18] And
while dichotomizing the entire economy in just two sectors might sound
as too much of an oversimplification,[^19] I follow @Dixit:1973aa [325]
in that the dual economy model provides a significantly better
description of the economy because “it reflects several vital social
*and* economic distinctions.”[^20] @Johnston1966 [280] also explain that
“\[t\]he reality found in most underdeveloped countries approximates
this dichotomy \[...\] sufficiently.” In fact, @Lindert1985 [354]
explain that the dual-sector model is “the dominant paradigm used by
Third World observers.” However, “balanced growth is almost axiomatic as
a desirable objective, for both developed *and* under-developed
countries.”[^21] For example, @Bergquist1986 [8] explains that
“Colombia’s two traditional political parties crystallized in the 1840’s
and reflected in many respects the dual nature of the Colombian
economy.” While this is a stylized model which approximates a
good-enough description of reality, @Dixit:1973aa [326] is right in that
a “major drawback of dualistic theories \[...\] is the total neglect of
the service sector.” However, the literature is consistent in that the
third sector necessarily develops *after* the industrial sector is
developed.[^22]

Economic development depends on the emergence of the industrial sector
which in turn depends on the development of a productive agricultural
sector.[^23] As @Kuznets1961a [59] puts it, “economic growth is
*impossible* unless there is a substantial rise in product per worker in
the agricultural sector.”[^24] Following @Jorgenson1961 [311],
@Ranis:1964uq [59], @Jorgenson1967 [291], @Skott1998 [279-280] and
@Vollrath2009a [290], the industrial sector is assumed to use capital
and labor and has increasing returns to scale, while the agriculture
sector is assumed to use only land (which is fixed) and labor (only
input).[^25] This implies that the industrial sector is *structurally*
protected: even when the agricultural sector is efficient, *ceteris
paribus*, it cannot grow faster than an efficient industrial sector. The
fixity of land requires countries to industrialize in order to grow, and
for that they need first an efficient agricultural sector. This insight
is shared by many other development economists. @Hayami1969 [105] for
example argue that “\[i\]ndustrialization and modern economic growth are
basically *conditioned* by the level of agricultural productivity.”[^26]
There are two main reasons for why agricultural development is a
prerequisite of industrial development: efficient agricultures are more
likely to supply the industrial sector with cheap foodstuff and cheap
labor. In @Johnston1951 [498]’s words, “\[e\]xpanded agricultural
productivity releases people from the land for employment in industry
\[and\] provides food for the growing population.” This structural
transformation is the key of economic growth. If the expansion of the
agricultural sector is compromised, it will necessarily compromise the
expansion of the industrial sector as well.[^27] The political correlate
is that weak inter-sectoral linkage structures engender weak *political*
elites, and uncontested *agricultural* elites in the case of Latin
America.

The first reason for why a productive agricultural sector is key to
industrial development is that more efficient agricultural techniques
make agricultural production less labor intensive, allowing landowners
to free workers which the industrial sector can rely on. The need for an
improvement in agricultural production as a necessary step prior to
industrialization “has been termed the ‘prerequisite’ hypothesis.”[^28]
Technologies such as “crop rotation, pest control, seed breeding \[and\]
fertilizer use \[represent\] the major potential source of agricultural
labor productivity.”[^29] @Nicholls1961 [339-340] shows that advanced
industrial countries initially had relatively more developed and
productive agricultural sectors. In fact, @Gallo:1991kx [57] finds that
in Bolivia, a primarily agricultural economy, “\[t\]he tools employed in
production were few and rudimentary, the use of fertilizers was minimal,
and methods for conservation of the soil were practically unknown until
the beginning of the 1950s.” However, highly industrialized countries
such as Japan, the U.K., the U.S.S.R. and Taiwan adopted *prior
industrialization* very efficient agricultural technologies such as
higher-yielding varieties, fertilizers and other activities that
improved farm practices.[^30]

Surplus of labor naturally leads to a reallocation of redundant workers
into the industrial sector, which is the crux of economic
development.[^31] @Nurkse:1953aa in fact argues that development *means*
to employ the surplus labor.[^32] The literature coincides in that the
‘natural role’ of the agricultural sector is to provide labor to the
industrial sector.[^33] For example, @Dixit:1973aa [326] argues that the
“agricultural sector *must* fulfill \[...\] its dual role of supplier of
labour to industry and of food for the industrial labour force.”[^34]
While @Lewis1954 in his canonical work argued that there existed an
‘unlimited’ supply of agricultural labor, a word of caution is in order.
The meaning of the supposedly ‘unlimitedness’ of labor should *not* be
taken literally, as in reality means *redundant labor force*.[^35] In
fact, @Nurske:1961qr [225] points out that the concept “is commonly used
to denote all types of rural unemployment.”[^36]

The second reason for why a productive agricultural sector is key to
industrial development is because efficient techniques in agricultural
production are able to supply cheaper foodstuff.[^37] “It is
*self-evident* that without increasing food output, the capitalist
sector must remain in a stationary state.”[^38] Food surplus is a direct
consequence of efficiency, and it is just as important as labor
reallocation. In sum, as @Kuznets1961a [60] explains it, if “output per
worker in agriculture does not rise substantially, economic growth in
the first case will be stopped by scarcity of agricultural products, and
in the second case by scarcity of labour.”

This structural transformation affects the labor structure as well. In
fact, @Harris1970 [134-135] explain that while “the creation of an
additional job in the urban area reduces agricultural output through
induced migration,” however the opposite is not true.[^39] This implies
that agriculture-industry productivity differentials “may even increase
with development.”[^40] Actually, @Serrano2016 find that in Latin
America there has been a declining role of agricultural exports as
industrialization levels have increased. That said, it is important to
say that “the agricultural sector declines relative to the overall
economy but continues to expand absolutely.”[^41] In other words, it is
the “the proportional contribution of agriculture to the growth”[^42]
what decays, implying that in the long run the agricultural sector “must
also grow,”[^43] specially given the continuing dependence on a constant
supply of food.[^44] Next presents two cases with special references to
structural transformations and political development.

Brief Historical References: Chile and Argentina\[case:studies\]
================================================================

#### Chile: A Story of Elite Competition and Compromises

Historically, Chilean agriculturalists had been a hegemonic group
protected by norms and institutions that originated in colonial times.
Those norms had survived due to institutional inertia, perpetuating
their advantaged position.[^45] As @Collier:2002db [106] argue, the
“national government was dominated by \[...\] owners of large
agricultural holdings,”[^46] while @Zeitlin:1984aa [13] explains that
“landowners controlled both the vote and the labor power of the agrarian
tenants \[and\] peasants \[...\] and this was the *sine qua non* of
their continuing political hegemony.” Similarly, @Baland2008 [1748]
explain that “\[c\]ongressional representation was heavily weighted in
favor of rural districts.” In the presidency also, landowners were the
single most represented group.[^47]

While on the one hand institutions, policies and other practices were
biased against industrial elites, on the other, rapid industrial growth
incentivized industrial elites to form pressure groups to offset the
bias against them. The little public infrastructure that existed
benefited the agricultural sector only. @Zeitlin:1984aa [41] explains
that “the Montt regime did invest in the construction of Chile’s
railways but only in the Central Valley and south-central zones \[b\]ut
there was no public investment \[...\] in railroads built in the Norte
Chico mining provinces.” To address this situation, industrialists
started to “form trade associations to engage in lobbying and
propaganda.”[^48] Eventually, these interests groups turned into
political parties.[^49] These new groups, backed by their economic
leverage, put pressures to open the political system in a way that
allowed industrial elites to gain egalitarian political conditions and
equal access to state power. While initially both elites confronted each
other in two civil wars,[^50] war was not sustainable over time. Given
their relative similar degrees of economic development, both elites
could mobilize armies with similar capabilities. Under egalitarian
conditions to engage in conflict, there were no incentives to make war,
and thus conflict was avoided generating a status of inter-sectoral
cooperation.[^51] War was then more likely to exhaust all existent
assets, leaving no clear winners after the conflict.[^52] Consequently,
Chilean agricultural and industrial elites opted for a political
compromise. The keystone of these inter-elite compromises was the
implementation of the income tax in 1924, which marked the beginning of
an institutionalization path. As others have observed, “\[t\]here was
visible bargaining: \[the non-agricultural sector\] (reluctantly)
accepted taxation, *while demanding state services and expecting to
influence how tax revenues were spent*.”[^53] The expansion of political
rights *among the elite* and the rise of the industrial sector shared
the same timing. As @Collier1977 [683] has pointed out, “the real story
of Chilean industrialization belongs to the Parliamentary period,” which
goes from 1891 to 1925.

Both sectors were efficient. While some have argued that the agriculture
sector was a backwards sector,[^54] @Robles-Ortiz2009 [511] has been the
main referent to argue the contrary. He explains that agriculturalists
adopted different mechanization processes, remarkably increasing its
productivity and output. As predicted by the dual economy model, this
led to a reallocation of labor, “especially in the 1870s with the onset
of the nitrate economy \[when\] thousands of men left the
countryside.”[^55] In fact, @Segall1962 [18] explains that the mining
sector attracted so much labor that the countryside eventually run out
of enough labor. He explains that by 1843, the landowning elite taking
advantage of its advantaged political position would implement in
Congress a law granting policeman the duty to force unemployed
individuals without a known contract to work forcefully in the
fields.[^56] Moreover, the scarcity of rural labor around 1873 forced to
pay laborers “twice as much as peons earned in the winter,”[^57]
exacerbating the inter-sectoral conflict.

#### Argentina: A Story of Structural Imbalances

In Argentina, there were two elites as well. Traditionally, it has been
argued that the economic cleavage was between an export-oriented sector
and an import-oriented sector. Based on the observation of others, I
consider the overlap between the export and agricultural sectors, and
the overlap between the import and the industrial sectors. As @Diaz1966
[25] argues in his classic series of papers, “while the correspondence
between exports and rural products, and between imports and manufactured
goods has not been perfect \[...\] such correspondence has been quite
close.”[^58]

This case presents an interesting paradox. The Argentinean industrial
sector was weaker compared to the Chilean industrial sector, however the
former grew faster than the later. As some have argued, there “is little
disagreement among economists that the period from 1875 to the eve of
World War I \[was\] the Golden Age \[...\] of Argentinean economic
history.”[^59] However, as @Bulmer-Thomas2003 [136] puts it, Argentina
“had a relatively backward industrial structure for a country of its
income and wealth. *Indeed, industrial labor productivity was lower than
in Chile* \[...\] *despite Argentina’s superior income per head*.”[^60]
The paradox can be explained by Argentina’s weak inter-elite structure,
but particularly by the weakness of the industrial elite. The literature
seems to agree on this point. @Bulmer-Thomas2003 [188] explains that
among the factors that explain Argentina’s failure was “a social
infrastructure geared to agroexports \[*and*\] *a powerful rural
elite*.” A relatively powerful traditional sector suffocated the full
potential of the modern sector, denying industrialists “the same status
\[the\] agroexports” had.[^61] And while the landed elites did promote
industrialization via protectionist tariffs, they did so by imposing
“modest tariff protection”[^62] which moreover were “not always
consistent.”[^63] Thus, while agriculturalists were more cohesive than
industrialists, they were still a weak class on its own. As others have
argued, landowners had a hard time obtaining “certain types of inputs
(fertilizers, tractors, etc.) which could conceivably have allowed it to
react to the decline in the real prices \[...\] by increasing
productivity.”[^64] Agricultural research was very limited too.[^65] Not
surprisingly, “in 1952 Argentina even had to spend precious foreign
exchange to import wheat,”[^66] suggesting a complete mis-allocation of
agricultural resources, and overall, supreme inefficiency regarding food
production.

In sum, these remarks suggest that *un*balanced economic growth is
associated with inter-sectoral political disparities, compromising
long-term economic growth and further investments in state institutions.
In an effort to suggest that this hypothesis could be generalized to
other countries in Latin America, next provides evidence of different
time-series models.

Time Series Analyses: Vector Autoregressive Models and Granger Causality Tests\[methods\]
=========================================================================================

#### Granger-causality Tests

The emergence of a new industrial sector rose a new politically
disenfranchised elite who demanded political and economic reforms
beneficial to them, ending years of political sectoral unbalances. In
exchange for these demands, the industrial sector accepted to be
income-taxed, setting countries in a path of both political and long-run
economic development. The income tax, as an institution that contributed
to develop further state capacities and institutional development,
should then be associated with long-term economic growth, and
consequently with a secular decline of agriculture and substantial
expansion of manufacturing. To confirm this hypothesis, the theory
should pass a number of tests. First, *before* the inter-sectoral
compromises (i.e., before the income tax law was implemented), political
institutions and social norms inherited from the colonial period were
designed to allocate economic inputs (and hence *growth*) in a way that
benefited the landowning class only. Hence, I expect the transference of
economic inputs went *from* the industrial sector *to* the agriculture
sector, a *backwards* equilibrium as stated by the dual sector model.
Second, *after* the income tax was implemented, we should see a
*reversion* of the flow of inputs, generating growth *from* the
agricultural sector *to* the industrial sector. In econometric terms, we
should see that the income tax reverted the way in which one sector
‘Granger-caused’ the other.[^67] @Lutkepohl2006 [42] explains that if
some variable $X$ forecasts variable $Y$ (and not vise versa), $X$ is
said to ‘Granger-cause’ $Y$. According to @Granger1980 [349], this
concept of ‘causation’ is based on the idea “that the future cannot
cause the past.”[^68]

To test this hypothesis I utilize the
[MOxLAD](http://moxlad-staging.herokuapp.com/home/en?) data,
particularly the *agriculture value-added* and *manufacturing
value-added* variables.[^69] The dataset spans from as early as 1900 to
as late as 2010.[^70] specifies the available time-span. Using secondary
information, the table also states *when* the income tax was
implemented, what the law was and its corresponding source(s).[^71]
Following @Mahoney:2010aa [5] I consider two ‘advanced’ economy
countries (Chile and Argentina), two ‘intermediate’ countries (Mexico
and Colombia) and two ‘less advanced’ countries (Guatemala and
Nicaragua). shows the sectoral outputs for each country, both before and
after the income tax law was implemented.

In I test for Granger-causation, i.e. the directionality in which
economic growth was produced both prior and after the implementation of
the income tax law.[^72] The table strongly suggests that the income tax
caused a structural transformation in (almost) all ‘developed’
countries, namely Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In all these cases the
income tax reverted the initial inter-sectoral growth equilibrium
suggesting a contested elite structure, as the case of Chile conveys.
Before the income tax law, industrial development Granger-caused
agricultural development, and after the income tax law, the agricultural
sector Granger-caused industrial development (all p-values are
significant at the $.05$ level).[^73] These results suggest that the
implementation of the income tax was associated to the overthrowing of
the political institutions and practices that permitted agricultural
expansion at the expenses of the modern sector, and that the reversion
of the original backwards macroeconomic structure set in motion a path
of long-term economic development. In Nicaragua and Guatemala the tests
suggest the exact opposite (all p-values are significant at the $.05$
level).[^74] The implementation of the income tax in these countries did
*not* revert the initial backward macroeconomic equilibrium because when
implemented, it did not reflect the inter-sectoral tensions, challenges
and compromises proper of the contested political economies. The
industrial sector never had enough economic leverage to politically
confront the landowning elite (see ) and hence industrialists never
posed credible threats to the status quo, relaxing the endogenous
incentives to invest in state institutions. The Argentinian case is
different. In line with the historical references, the Granger tests are
inconclusive, and no significant results were found, suggesting weak
inter-sectoral linkages.

#### Vector Autoregressive Models (VARs) and Impulse Response Analysis (IRFs)

Once we have determined the directionality of economic growth is
associated with the imposition of the income tax law, it is necessary to
establish the inter-sectoral long-run economic equilibrium. This
relationship is an endogenous one.[^75] If this endogeneity is not
accounted for, the error term and the regressors will be correlated, and
so OLS will be inconsistent. Additionally, growth rates are usually
integrated. ‘Unit root’ or ‘integrated’ *I(1)* vectors[^76] are
time-series that “wander” up and down, yet they never revert to a given
mean.[^77] Moreover, two integrated vectors that are mutually
endogenous, such as industrial and agricultural outputs, imply a
‘cointegrated’ CI(1) relationship, imposing additional statistical
restrictions.[^78] A “set of integrated time-series is said to be
cointegrated if some linear combination of the series in levels produces
a stationary series,” or *I(0)*.[^79] The economic literature generally
coincides in that economic growth is an I(1) process, and that sectoral
development is a CI(1) process.

Integration and cointegration are assumptions that should be tested. The
first step is to find strong evidence of integration in each of the
series. In I show several unit root tests.[^80] The table indicates that
all variables, periods, sectors and countries have I(1) processes. The
second step is to find evidence of cointegration.[^81] Substantively,
cointegration would mean that there is a long-lasting mutual
inter-sectoral economic *dependence*, allowing *both* sectors to grow in
a balanced fashion. The political correlate of balanced growth is that
both elites would have the same economic leverage to influence the state
and policy outcomes. In turn, failure to find evidence of cointegration
would imply coordination failures between the two sectors (economic
backwardness), the delayed emergence of a political challenger, the lack
of a sectoral political conflict, and consequently a politically
unchallenged landed elite. Given that the maximum number of cointegrated
vectors is 1, I only test for the minimum number of cointegrated
relationships.[^82] I expect to find evidence of cointegration only in
the ‘developed’ cases. Following @Johansen1988, indicates that all
‘developed’ and ‘semi-developed’ countries have cointegrated series,
while ‘less developed’ countries do not have cointegrated series.[^83]

Cointegration “implies a particular kind of model” to estimate the
series.[^84] If traditional methods are used, given the interdependent
relationship of these kinds of time-series, the results will be
spurious.[^85] I use the vector-autoregressive approach (VAR) specified
in @Johansen1988 which among several advantages, is estimated via MLE.
Another advantage is that VAR models do not need to specify the number
of cointegrated vectors as opposed to error correction models.[^86]
Formally, I will model the next reduced form VAR in differences, one per
country, both before and after the income tax law was passed:

$$\label{var:1}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \bigtriangleup M_{t_{m}} = & \alpha_{m} + \beta_{m}  \bigtriangleup M_{t-l} + \beta_{m} \bigtriangleup A_{t-l} + \epsilon_{t_{m}} \\
    \bigtriangleup A_{t_{a}} = & \alpha_{a} + \beta_{a}  \bigtriangleup M_{t-l} + \beta_{a} \bigtriangleup A_{t-l} + \epsilon_{t_{a}}
  \end{array}$$

Notice that in both lines the different dependent variables are
expressed as a function of the *same* set of lagged independent
variables. Since the number of lags $l$ varies by country *and*
time-span (i.e. before/after the income tax law), is in standard form.
describes the optimal lags specified in each country regression.[^87]
Most tests give satisfactory results.

Given that “it is often difficult to draw any conclusions from the large
number of coefficient estimates in a VAR system,”[^88] econometricians
usually turn to the analyses of *impulse response functions* (IRFs),
which are derived from VAR analyses.[^89] “Impulse responses trace out
the response of current and future values of each of the variables to a
one-unit increase in the current value of one of the VAR errors.”[^90]
shows four panels for each of the six countries, one for the response of
agriculture to industrial growth (left column), one for the response of
industrial growth to agricultural growth (right column), both before
(top row) and after (bottom row) the implementation of the income tax.
Similar to the Granger-causality tests, I expect politically ‘developed’
countries to have gone through a process of structural transformation
reverting the initial backwards development trap. However, this time I
am able to observe the intensity of the responses and how long it took
them to die out. The X-axis are years, and represent any year. The
Y-axis is *not* growth, but response to equilibrium. That is, the
reaction of one sector once the other one is shocked.[^91]

suggests that all ‘developed’ countries switched from a backwards
equilibrium to a modern economic growth strategy after the income tax
was implemented. For example, a shock to industrial growth in Chile
before the tax has a positive and increasing effect on agriculture.
However, after the income tax is adopted, a shock on industry has a
negligible effect on agricultural output. This suggests that the
political institutions before the tax were oriented to channel all
economic resources in a way such that to give advantage to the
agricultural sector and the landed elites. This situation was reverted
after the income tax law. Colombia and Mexico show a similar pattern.
While the analyses on the Argentinean case suggest that there is a
long-term inter-sectoral relationship (), according to and this
relationship is weak, indicating weak inter-sectoral complementarity.
Nicaragua and Guatemala are the prototypical backward cases. In each
case, the economy was designed to develop the agricultural sector
completely at the expenses of the industrial sector. This goes in line
with the null findings of cointegration in and Granger-causality tests
in . In these cases the effect of a shock to agricultural output on
industrial output is zero both before and after the implementation of
the income tax law, suggesting a situation of *unbalanced* economic
growth. The political correlate is the lack of a strong political
challenger. suggests that the industrial sector was always week,
indicating that their corresponding political elites were unable to
contest the landowning class. In both cases the implementation of the
income tax did not revert the initial backward macroeconomic equilibrium
because when implemented, it did not reflect the inter-sectoral
tensions, challenges and compromises proper of the contested political
economies.

Discussion\[discussion\]
========================

Elites split along economic interests will use state power to influence
certain policies and hence, growth and state building in different ways.
I have argued that the emergence of the industrial sector caused
political development by rising a political challenger. The argument
differs deeply from modernization theory. What causes political
development is not industrialization *per se*, but the development of a
productive landed elite which supplied labor and cheap foodstuff to the
modern sector, promoting *balanced* economic development between the
*two* sectors. In turn, balanced growth politically empowered *both*
economic elites. When there were weak inter-sectoral linkages and lack
of economic complementarity between the two sectors, countries not only
failed to grow, but also produced uncontested political environments,
and investments in political institutions were less likely. The radical
transformation of the economy is a precondition for political
development.

Two brief historical references were discussed. The Chilean case
stresses the importance of sectoral competition and the role of income
taxation, while the Argentinean case focuses on an important issue,
namely, the overlap between the export/agriculture and import/industry,
a recurrent topic in Latin American economic history. Time-series
analyses, particularly, Granger-causality tests and VAR models (and
IRFs) were presented in an effort to suggest that this theory can be
applied to other countries in the region. There are good reasons to
believe that the theory has general applicability to other cases.

[^16]: @Jorgenson1961 [311]. Importantly, I follow @Kuznets:1967aa [87]
    in that “mining is combined with \[...\] industry because of the
    large scale of its productive unit, its close connection with
    manufacturing, and the distinctive trend in its share in product and
    resources.” Similarly, @Debowicz2014 [237] includes mining within
    the industrial sector.

[^17]: Just to name a few examples, @Thirlwall1986, @Mathur1990,
    @Hatton1991, @Blunch2006, @Tiffin2003 and @Kanwar2000 study sectoral
    growth, shock persistence, and other related topics using the same
    theoretical framework and methodology I employ in this paper (or
    some variation of it).

[^18]: @Kelley:1972zl [8].

[^19]: This is a stylized theory. Of course, in reality, there are other
    economic activities such as logging, mining and others. Given its
    dependence on capital, mining has always been considered industrial.
    The Chilean case illustrates this.

[^20]: Emphasis is mine.

[^21]: @Streeten1959 [169]. Emphasis is mine.

[^22]: @Galenson1963 [506-507, 513] and @Baer1966 [95-96].

[^23]: @Johnston1961 [567] argue that this process “seems to be a
    necessary condition for cumulative and self-sustaining growth.”

[^24]: Emphasis is mine.

[^25]: And while agriculture also needs capital (@Federico:2008xd [40]),
    its *main* input is land.

[^26]: Emphasis is mine.

[^27]: In fact @Landon-Lane2003 [2] find that an important source of
    growth in developing economies is “derived through the reallocation
    of resources \[particularly\] by drawing labour moving out of
    traditional sector employment into the modern sector.”

[^30]: @Johnston1961 [571] and @Johnston1951 [507-508]. Similarly
    @Caselli2005 [723] explains that poorer economies have inefficient
    agricultural sectors which at the same time are the mayor source of
    employment.

[^31]: @Ranis:1964uq [7] and @Leibenstein:1957aa [51].

[^32]: Similarly, @Matsuyama1991 [621-622] points out that
    “\[i\]ndustrialization \[*consists of*\] a shift of resources from
    agriculture to manufacturing.”

[^33]: @Ranis:1964uq [114] argue that “labor reallocation \[...\] is the
    *inevitable* and *natural* consequence of the continuous expansion
    of agricultural labor productivity.” Emphases are mine.

[^34]: Emphasis is mine.

[^35]: See @Ranis:1964uq [203] and @Jorgenson1967 [289].

[^36]: Or as @Leibenstein1957 [102-103] puts it, “where the existing
    labor supply could cultivate more land without loss of efficiency.”
    In any case, @Sen1966b explains that a number of important
    predictions made by the dual sector model do not need this
    assumption to hold for the model to work. On a separate note,
    @Ranis:1964uq [99], @Skott1998 [280] and @Fields2004 [730] argue
    that a pool of *redundant* agricultural workers (a ‘reserve army’)
    is what prevents a rise in industrial wages.

[^67]: This is not an experimental design, and hence the term
    ‘causation’ should be taken loosely. As @Beck1992 [241] explains,
    cointegration is not causal.

[^68]: See @Durr1992 [197] for a similar definition.

[^69]: The former measures “the output of the sector net of intermediate
    inputs and includes the cultivation of crops, livestock production,
    hunting, forestry and fishing.” The later “\[r\]eports the output of
    the sector net of intermediate inputs.”

[^70]: According to @Astorga2005 [790], this dataset provides extended
    *comparable* sectoral value-added series in constant purchasing
    power parity prices.

[^71]: Some countries implemented some kind of income tax before,
    however these laws lacked enforcement, they were weak or not at all
    followed. In in the Appendix section I establish the year that the
    literature seems to agree for when the law was implemented and
    properly enforced.

[^72]: Specifically, the tests were computed after estimating the
    reduced form VAR specified in .

[^73]: Except for the Mexico after the implementation of the income tax
    (p-value = $.06$).

[^74]: Except for the pre income tax period test of Guatemala, which is
    significant at the $.1$ level.

[^75]: @Tiffin2003 [33].

[^76]: The order of integration could be higher than 1. However, for
    simplicity sake, I restrict my analyses to I(1) processes, which is
    the most common strategy in applied econometric analyses of time
    series.

[^78]: See @Granger1981 and @Engle1987).

[^80]: I show the test statistic and its associated MacKinnon
    approximate p-value in parenthesis for the ADF and Phillips-Perron
    tests. Both trend and drift were tested in all tests, when
    applicable. As I did not find any differences, I show the test
    statistic with no trend nor drift and one lag. The lags in the KPSS
    test were selected via an automatic procedure. “$+$” indicates that
    the test is barely significant or non-significant.

[^81]: I use VAR regressions, which do not necessarily need cointegrated
    vectors (see @Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe [161, 164]). Cointegration,
    however, is important from a substantive standpoint in this paper.

[^82]: @Box-Steffensmeier:2014fe [165].

[^83]: Since I am interested in the long-run equilibrium, I do not split
    the sample before and after the implementation of the income tax.

[^84]: @Wooldridge2002 [571]. Cointegrated vectors, ECMs and VARs are
    widely common in political science too. Just to mention some
    examples, refer to @Ostrom1992, @Krause1997, @Fish2007, @Haber2011,

[^87]: The next information criteria were used to determine the
    appropriate lag length: final prediction error, AIC, Schwarz’s
    Bayesian information criterion, Hannan and Quinn criterion as well
    as the corresponding likelihood-ratio test statistics. The same
    criteria are used to compute the optimal lag length in . The table
    also shows a summary of different post-estimation tests when the
    optimum lag length specified in the table was used. A check mark
    indicates that the tests was passed successfully, a check-minus mark
    indicates that the test was passed somewhat successfully, and a
    cross mark denotes failure to reject specification problems.
